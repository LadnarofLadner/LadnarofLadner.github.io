 <p> Scientists must be adept at both hypothesizing, creatively, and doing the follow-up, rigorous work, of designing, executing and interpreting the results of their experiments.

  Chemistry and Physics, considered the "gold-standard" of the sciences, are repeatable, and staistical in nature, and best done with independent verification or double blind studies.

  Some sciences, however, have an inherently historical quality (i.e. volcanism, geology, natural history, evolution, cultural enathropolgy, human history, etc.) and thus, do not fit the above model. There is no "rewinding the tape" to try again.
 
 So, in claiming both to be far-left in politics, and yet still nonpartisan, I am merely invoking my professional nonpartisanship, as a scientist. I have the liberality, and flexibility, to change things and hypothesize, but the conservative nature of knowing what works--what has always worked in the past--and how to get from the present state to a desired state. In short, my decisions will be always based upon a balnce of the best available scientific, statistical and historical evidence.</p>
