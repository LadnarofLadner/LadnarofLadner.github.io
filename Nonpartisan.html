 <p Scientists must be adept at both hypothesizing, creatively, and doing the follow-up, rigorous work of designing, executing and interpreting their experiments.

  Chemistry and Physics, considered the "gold-standard" of the sciences, are rpeeatable, and best done with independent cerification or double blind studies.

  Some sciences, however, are inherently historicasl in nature (i.e. volcanism, geology, natural history, evolution, cultural enathropolgy, human history, etc.). There is no "rewinfding the tape" to try again.</p>
