<p style="color:Yellow;">Thank you for navigating to my page, and thanks, in advance, for your support. Here is a little bit of biographical infomrmation about me. I am so Far-Left that I've fallen off the American politcal scale, sometime around 1996-2000. I was born in Plainfield, Vermont, and grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island (1988-2004). I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology from the University of Rhode Island, on a full tuition scholarship. After 2004, I moved back to Plainfield, Vermont, in search of graduate school positions and scientific work, where I remained, waiting, patiently, until about 2014, when I ran for Congress, and debated Rep. Peter Welch (D., now Senator), and others, on Vermont Public Television. Despite my sincere reservations about the direction the country was going in, my warnings, apparently, went unheeded, and I remain under-utilized and un-utilized, in our modern economy. This is a poisionous economy. Period, full stop.</p>

<p style="color:Yellow;">When I claim to be Far-Left, I should be a bit more specific. It is more accurate to call me extremely progressive, though, due to some professional proclivities and obligations, and to some phislosophical predilections, "progressive" must be understood in a somewhat limited sense. I am, however, emphatically not Socialist or Communist, though I do not shrink from the labels, as I find the perjorative to be a dull and dimwitted, and extremely outdated one (we are, after all, "all Keynesians, now...", as one noted wag has commented.). I am, however, a full-throated supporter of community and society, which share the root words of those dreaded "-isms", but I also support, and enjoy, capital, the root-word for the other "boogeyman" of modern politics, "capitalism". Here I part with many "Liberals", who often assume that possession of "capital" or profession of ideas which support the creation of value, which often involves the creation and/or use of capital, is somehow "selling out". Money, like community and society, is an OK thing to value; it is the elevation of these things to "-isms", reified to God-like or religious status, which causes problems (in my opinion).</p>

<p style="color:Yellow;">About halfway through my bachelor's degree, I began to suspect that I was an evolution biologist, and not as destined for a career in marine biology, as I had previously thought. I was quite enamoured with the works of Stephen Jay Gould, and with the history of life, as exemplified by the famous studies of the three dimensional, soft-bodied, Burgess shale fossils and of Edicarean fauna (Vendobionta). This new perspective, and its competing instantiations as promulgated by Dawkins, Dennett, E.O. Wilson, Chomsky, and others, provided part of a worldview that was at least moderately hostile to any notion of absolute or true "progress"; since even the lowliest living tapeworm is as equally "evolved" or progressed" as any living human being. But for our present purposes, the purposes of politics, and as a general humanistic philosophy, I accept a more limited use of the word "progress" and apply it to improving the lot and condition of the 8 billion people on this earth, for their continued health, happiness, and peaceable co-existence.</p>

<p style="color:Yellow;">Turning from the philosophical, semantic, and from vocabulary items and definitions, and continuing in the vein of the biographical, I do not believe it is hyperbole or braggadocio to claim that my life experience and broad philosophical background is outsized when viewed next to my actual resume-worthy achievements. It is hard to describe, or explain, but I am a bit humbled looking back at a useful life, that was lived, and actually actively constructed, by me, despite the incessant employment-related setbacks. I did manage about 6 months as a mortgage company temp (light office work and document collection and storage), about 6 months as a food technician at a regional and national dairy company/co-operative, and about 6 months in quality control, as Rapid Thermal Anneal Operator, at an international, Forbes 500, semiconductor manufacturing company. Despite these jobs, and the soul-sucking toll they exacted upon a "man of the woods", I managed, in each case, respectively, to further my true aims, first, by taking additional botany courses (a marine biologist has little need for expertise concerning the true vascular plants, since the ocean is largely devoid of them!), and, second, by purchasing a book "Scientific Charge Coupled Devices", authored by James Janesick (a week's paycheck!) and third, by using my tech employment to support myself while I imagined the "Post-Moore's Law" world; a world of Strong-A.I., governed, largely, by "Meyer's (Linguistic) Law". In this last case, I used my time off to study, intently, electrical engineering, optical engineering, human vision, and digital imaging, amongst other subjects. </p>
