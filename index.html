     <p style="color:Black;">Thank you for navigating to my page, and thanks, to 3,937 of you, for your support in the Hawaii Congressional Election, 2nd District, 2024. The old website, political crankiness and all, is archived, in its inchoate state, as listed above, in the two links, both in black-and-white, and in green-and-yellow (as a joke). This new and improved website will probably focus, mostly, on (A) my human and robotic (Anthropomorphic and Anthropo-Functional Imagers) optics research (circa 2002-2019+), (B) my more recent olfactory transducer research, and (C) my older, crankier (yet clever!) political songs (circa 2012-2019), and my newer, simpler, sweeter, love-lust-and-beauty-and-poetry songs.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">Finally, a bit of order to the chaos ! Perhaps? Just below this missive, please find 6 links, summarizing life, work, research, thoughts both mature and hypothetical, and a general synopsis of a lifetime ( b.1980, and 2002-2025) of academic study, "on the cheap" and "on the fly".</p>

 <p style="color:Black;"> HOW IS MY RESEARCH, AFTER THE ELECTION OF 2024? It is going pretty well. I have eschewed, for about 20 years, the "sexy research", wherein, young graduate students follow directly in their mentors footsteps, embracing their pet projects, and including, almost invariably, the "buzz words" in their grant proposals, so as to rain down upon the chosen few, the choicest of government grants, foundation support, and corporate funding. Not that I am opposed, entirely, to that way of doing things, but it just isn't my style and never was. I prefer to think independently, and speak my mind, create freely and unencumbered, and, basically, to retain the freedom to chart my own course, in my own research. But, alas, I find I have succumbed to the utilization of a few buzz words, and even enjoy the papers these colleagues have published over the previous 20 years. I will, very specifically, be using three cutting-edge technologies that I have no right to claim to have furthered, myself, but hope to make such contributions, in the near future. Chief among these, will be : (A) DNA and olfactory receptor research, (B) Nanodisk research, (C) Microfluidics. And, as of 2025, and late-2024, I find such things as Cryo-EM, MINFLUX, and other fluorescent microscopy and labelling techniques to be intriguing avenues for the exploration of (1) protein structures and (2) for the de-orphanization and the study of the change of protein structures when in the presence of agonist and antagonist molecules.</p>

   <p style="color:Black;"> HOW IS MY RESEARCH (Pre- and During Election)? It is, surprisingly, doing well, thanks for asking! This section is probably under active construction (early July 2024), as the research is ongoing, so I will just add a few broken links here, until I get the basics "fleshed out". Alluded to above, Meyer's Law, and the associated Meyer-Hardy-Weinberg Eqillibruium was censored and silenced, circa 2003, when I was ostracised and black-balled--albeit, politely, and subtly--from academia. I was further silenced, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election_in_Vermont">several times</a>, by <a href="https://github.com/LadnarofLadner/LadnarofLadner.github.io/blob/main/Wikipedia%20Revenge%20Meyer%20Hardy%20Weinbrerg%20Equillibrium%201%201.jpg?raw=true">gutless wikipedia editors</a>, and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch">minor bureacratic tyrants</a> (preferring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections">describe me</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Hawaii">"failed politician"</a> rather than admitting that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont%27s_at-large_congressional_district">silenced and censored academician</a>!). A quick list of the successful research since that inital raw deal would include (1) designs for anthropomorphic imagers, both FOIC and CCD/CMOS Roughly-Spherical Goldberg Polyhedra Tesselations, (2) Meyer's Optical Approximation of the Human Eye; both as mathematical model and as an empirical, engineered and manufactured instantiation, (3) Meyer's Law, stated, for simplicity, here, as VN^2=S, and derived from the permutation and combination equations and the simplest cross-cultural accounting of human linguistic typologies, (4) Massively Parallel Anthropomorphic (Anthropo-Functional) Olfactory and Gustatory Transducers, (5) Meyer's Standard Strong A.I. Directories (MSSAID), an extension of the Linux Standard Base (LSB), Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), to include 5 new directories (.olf, .gust, .vis, .aud, and .tact), one each for the raw data of the five senses of the human animal, (6) Olfactory and Gustatory Bitmaps (.olf and ol4, and .gust) to serve as a repositiory for the digitized information produced by these newly designed transducers, (7) and ... ... </p>

 
<p style="color:Red;">SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION : THIS IS KINDA MESSY? NEXT TIME I WORK ON THIS, I WILL SPLIT IT INTO 3 PERIODS (A) COLLEGE SONGS (URI : 1998-2002), (B) WGDR and VT SONGS (2012-2018), AND MAYBE ADD A SECTION (C) EUGENE, OREGON; VANCOUVER, BC (LADNER); AND HILO, HAWAII SONGS (2019-PRESENT)? </p>

 <p style="color:Red;">JUST KIDDING! Here I am, and its a new day, and I am altering the website, again, and I think I've decided that, despite being far far far far Left, and a proponent of "Copyleft" principles (Steal this website, its ideas, and its music!), I am also, emphatically NOT a Communist or Socialist or Capitalist. Famously, (or not-so-famously) I ran for Congress (2024, HI) on a ***ahem*** "platform" of "I like capital, and society, and community; but not religions; not "-isms" ". I think this is a sensible position, for me. So I have decided, perhaps contrary to my intentions, stated directly above, to organize the music in a way to sell the songs. Perhaps, I'll leave the stuff below, alone, for now, and start a different page, on a different link, and call it a "Go Fund Yourself" page. After all , when I left college, back in 2002, that is what EVERYBODY wants me to do. I can do NO SCIENCE until I Go Fund Myself???! That's seems like a rather rude declaration, but, whatevs? So, if you like my music and you want to put it in your next crappy Netflix emo-binge series (or in your quality, A-list movie or Cannes Festival, indie flick?), just send CASH MONEY to me, and we got a deal. All songs will be listed with prices and what rights are given and, assume, if rights not listed, they are retained by the author, me. Of course, you can also negotiate, cuz "I'm easy". I can re-record them, for more money, with no--zero--guarantees that you will like the output, but yes-guarantees that I will (a) pay a professional soundman, (b) try real hard, and (c) do the contracted hours of work to get the song into a more suitable, well-recorded state. But I am unwilling to do more than 3 hours to get one of my demos into a better state, so.... there's that ... You still get to use the demo if you don't like the final attempt, but the extra money to re-record, was, then, perhaps, "a wash'. I figure 1$k or 2$k is fair, for my attempt, 3 hours, and  soundman? I'm easy. Let's negotiate. Music is good, and fun... (why make it "business"?). I will put more detail on the page. Most songs will be short 1/2 or 1 minute snippets. Most full demos are 2 or 3 minutes, with 2 to 3 mistakes, some of them semi-major mistakes. Assuming its a movie "mood piece" you can cut the gaff out,. really easily. Average prices, for demos, "as is", is 3$k to 5$k. It includes rights to lyrics sheets and chord sheets (but those will be posted and free anyway), and crucially, rights for you to go hire somebody else to perform it better than I can. Like, hire a REAL singer-musician ... So, without further ado, navigate here, and listen to a few snippets. Maybe I will organize them by moods?<a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/GoFundYourself.html">Go Fund Yourself</a><p> </p>
