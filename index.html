     <p style="color:Black;">Thank you for navigating to my page, and thanks, to 3,937 of you, for your support in the Hawaii Congressional Election, 2nd District, 2024. The old website, political crankiness and all, is archived, in its inchoate state, as listed above, in the two links, both in black-and-white, and in green-and-yellow (as a joke). This new and improved website will probably focus, mostly, on (A) my human and robotic (Anthropomorphic and Anthropo-Functional Imagers) optics research (circa 2002-2019+), (B) my more recent olfactory transducer research, and (C) my older, crankier (yet clever!) political songs (circa 2012-2019), and my newer, simpler, sweeter, love-lust-and-beuaty-and-poetry songs.</p>

 <p style="color:Black;"> HOW IS MY RESEARCH, AFTER THE ELECTION OF 2024? It is going pretty well. I have eschewed, for about 20 years, the "sexy research", wherein, young graduate students follow directly in their mentors footsteps, embracing their pet projects, and including, almost invariably, the "buzz words" in their grant proposals, so as to rain down upon the chosen few, the choicest of government grants, foundation support, and corporate funding. Not that I am opposed, entirely, to that way of doing things, but it just isn't my style and never was. I prefer to think independently, and speak my mind, create freely and unencumbered, and, basically, to retain the freedom to chart my own course, in my own research. But, alas, I find I have succumbed to the utilization fo a few buzz words, and even enjoy the papers these colleagues have published over the previous 20 years. I will, very specifically, be using three cutting edge technologies that I have no right to claim to have furthered, myself, but hope to make such contributions, in the near future. Chuief among these, will be : (A) DNA and olfactory receptor research, (B) Nanodisk research, (C) Microfluidics.</p>

   <p style="color:Black;"> HOW IS MY RESEARCH (Pre- and During Election)? It is, surprisingly, doing well, thanks for asking! This section is probably under active construction (early July 2024), as the research is ongoing, so I will just add a few broken links here, until I get the basics "fleshed out". Alluded to above, Meyer's Law, and the associated Meyer-Hardy-Weinberg Eqillibruium was censored and silenced, circa 2003, when I was ostracised and black-balled--albeit, politely, and subtly--from academia. I was further silenced, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election_in_Vermont">several times</a>, by <a href="https://github.com/LadnarofLadner/LadnarofLadner.github.io/blob/main/Wikipedia%20Revenge%20Meyer%20Hardy%20Weinbrerg%20Equillibrium%201%201.jpg?raw=true">gutless wikipedia editors</a>, and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch">minor bureacratic tyrants</a> (preferring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections">describe me</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Hawaii">"failed politician"</a> rather than admitting that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont%27s_at-large_congressional_district">silenced and censored academician</a>!). A quick list of the successful research since that inital raw deal would include (1) designs for anthropomorphic imagers, both FOIC and CCD/CMOS Roughly-Spherical Goldberg Polyhedra Tesselations, (2) Meyer's Optical Approximation of the Human Eye; both as mathematical model and as an empirical, engineered and manufactured instantiation, (3) Meyer's Law, stated, for simplicity, here, as VN^2=S, and derived from the permutation and combination equations and the simplest cross-cultural accounting of human linguistic typologies, (4) Massively Parallel Anthropomorphic (Anthropo-Functional) Olfactory and Gustatory Transducers, (5) Meyer's Standard Strong A.I. Directories (MSSAID), an extension of the Linux Standard Base (LSB), Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), to include 5 new directories (.olf, .gust, .vis, .aud, and .tact), one each for the raw data of the five senses of the human animal, (6) Olfactory and Gustatory Bitmaps (.olf and ol4, and .gust) to serve as a repositiory for the digitized information produced by these newly designed transducers, (7) and ... ... </p>
