<p style="color:Black;">I graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 2002, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology, and, while kicking around my (other) hometown, Warwick, RI, looking for academic jobs, and, more to the point, a PhD position, I stumbled across some interesting websites concerning silicon image sensors. These sensors utilized the wavelengths of visible light, meqasured at different absorption depths in the silicon, as a unique way of separating the color visual channels, rather than the more traditional method of a color fitler array,  CFA array, or dichroic mirror-filter splitting prism (i.e. a 3-CCD setup). </p>

<br>

<p> This was the beginning, at age 22, of my lifelong study of Optical and Electrical Engineering, a task that really gained momentum, circa 2005, when I purchased James Janesick's book "Scientific Charge Coupled Devices". It was also areound this time I became acquainted with Rudolf Lunenberg's work on Non-Euclidean visual space (which I somewhat disagreed with), and Polyak's book on the vertebrate retina, Helmholtz's classic work, Rudolph Kingslake's work on photographic lens design, Oyster's work on the anatomy and function of the human eye, and Smith and Atchison's compendium of optical models of the eye. But progress was incrmeental, and there are far too many specific, minor and major works, inbetween those listed, to proceed in narrative fashion, but by about 2010, I had most of the knowledge needed to attempt a geometric study, on a Euclidean basis, of (1) human object space, (2) human image space, and (3) human visual space. </p>

<p style="color:Black;">Vision Research</p>

<p style="color:Black;">Inchoate Thoughts: A Brief Outline</p>

<p style="color:Black;">1. Oyster's wonderful textbook</p>

<p style="color:Black;">2. Davson's reference work</p>

<p style="color:Black;">3. Polyak's highly technical (too technical?) work</p>

<p style="color:Black;">4. Wertheim's data on peripheral viusual acuity</p>

<p style="color:Black;">5. Federico Faggin's involvement with Foveon company, and their unique and innovative product</p>

<p style="color:Black;">6. George Gilder's hack-piece, titled, rather pompously "The Silicon Eye".</p>

<p style="color:Black;">7. Rudolph Kingslake's 2 major works "A History of the Photographic Lens" and "Lens Design Fundamentals"</p>

<p style="color:Black;">8. Smith and Atchison's synopsis of Human Optical System models, circa 2000.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">9. Gullstrand's Nobel Prize winning work on the "Gullstrand Model" of human optical system.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">10. Osterberg's origional retinal cell counts, of rods and cones (approx. 120 million rods, 6.5 nmillion cones), and Curcio et. al's (1990s) revision of those numbers (approx. 90 million rods, and 4.5 million cones). How many "megapixels" is the human retina?</p>

<p style="color:Black;">11. West and Eshraghian's "CMOS VLSI circuit design and manufacture"</p>

<p style="color:Black;">12. Wakerly's "Hardware Design with Verilog and VHDL"</p>

<p style="color:Black;">13. Barry Brey's "Assembly Language, the 8086, 8088, and Intel Pentium Microprocessors"</p>

<p style="color:Black;">14. Rodnay Zaks "Programming the 6502"</p>

<p style="color:Black;">15. Sandini, Van der Spiegel, et al.'s 1980 design for a foveated CCD image sensor, and their 1989 implementation, in silicio</p>

<p style="color:Black;">16. James Janesick's "Scientific Charge Coupled Devices". Janesick's webnsite showing (a) his first piointing a CCD at an astronomical object, and (b) his early garage band, recording "hey Joe" beforfe Hendrix did. NOTE: Galieleo's father was a scholar of the Lute, and transcribed anceitn Greek texts to recover the songs. galleo was the first to pioint a lens at an astronomical object. It seems musicians are capable of a lot of "firsts"? Perhaps my Olfactory sensor will be a similar first?</p>

<p style="color:Black;">17. David Park "Fire in the Eye", circa 1999</p>

<p style="color:Black;">18. G.H. Gliddon, 1929 "An Optical Replica of the Human Eye"</p>

<p style="color:Black;">19. Schutlz, D. "**Human Eye Replica # 2 ?***", Australasian Journal of Optometry and Ophthalmology: This paper, and the Gliddon paper (above) represent, to my knowledge, the only attempts to construct scale models (2:1 or 1:1 scale models ratios) until modern times (circa 2011) with the work of Pier Gobbi (in the field of human eye prothestics), and others, following shortly thereafter (but rather feebly, in my view!).</p>

<p style="color:Black;">20. Harry Edwin Burton, "Euclid's Optics" the first English translation, JOSA article</p>

<p style="color:Black;">21. Lunenburg, circa 2945, "Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision", and his emphasis (I think, incorrectly) on Non-Euclidean Geomtery.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">22. Adelbert Ames and Proictr, "Dioptrics of the Human Eye", JOSA.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">23. Irving Adler "A New Look at Geomtetry" which, while ultimately unconvincing on the subject of the validity and usefulness of Non-Euclidean Geomtery, provided excellent and meticulous historical analysis, and even a pithy expalanation for why someone might WANT to utilize Non-Euclidian geomtery. The title of his chapter, or section, "Euclid Dethroned, Euclid Triumphant" was humouorous, but ultimately unsatisfying, to me. His work was largely welcomed by me, due to my legal and professional and financial difficulties , and it was nice to know that other person, living in Vermont (albeit, in a different age; McCarthyian age ! 1950s !) had similar run-ins with the illegitimate authorities in the Untided States. See my section on my later legal troubles (<p><a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Politics.html"> 6. Politics, Life, and Law</a><p> ), wherein, within my filed legal documents, I cited the poor treatment of Adler--the relevance by analogy, or identical cirscumstance, of our poor treatment--my colleague, separated in time and political leanings (both "Left", but, at quick glance, I am probably less socialist or communistic) in-exile.</p>
