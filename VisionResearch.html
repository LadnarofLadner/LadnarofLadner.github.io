<br>

<p style="color:Black;">I graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 2002, with a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology, and, while kicking around my (other) hometown, Warwick, RI, looking for academic jobs, and, more to the point, a PhD position, I stumbled across some interesting websites concerning silicon image sensors. These sensors utilized the wavelengths of visible light, measured at different absorption depths in the silicon, as a unique way of separating the color visual channels, rather than the more traditional method of a color filter array,  CFA array, or dichroic mirror-filter splitting prism (i.e. a 3-CCD setup). </p>

<br>

<p> This was the beginning, at age 22, of my lifelong study of optical and electrical engineering, a task that really gained momentum, circa 2005, when I purchased James Janesick's book "Scientific Charge-Coupled Devices". It was also around this time I became acquainted with Rudolf Lunenberg's work on Non-Euclidean visual space (which I somewhat disagreed with), and Polyak's book on the vertebrate retina, Helmholtz's classic work, Rudolph Kingslake's work on photographic lens design, Oyster's work on the anatomy and function of the human eye, and Smith and Atchison's compendium of optical models of the eye. But progress was incremental, and there are far too many specific, minor and major works, inbetween those listed, to proceed in narrative fashion. By about 2010, I had most of the knowledge needed to attempt a geometric study, on a Euclidean basis, of (1) human object space, (2) human image space, and (3) human visual space. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Sometime circa 2004-2005, whilst house-sitting in Calais or Woodbury, VT, I happenend upon the owner's art materials and, having recently heavily perused Eugene Hecht's textbook "Optics", I sat down at their drafting table to create an admittedly limited sketch of the monocular field of view of the human animal. Hecht had noted that, for a young eye, 12.5 cm (about 5 inches) is the near-point of accommodation , and 1 to 3 to 5 meters, depending upon illumination levels and the resulting reflexive diameter of the pupil, was the far-point of accomodation; at which point, the optical system effectively is focussed to infinity, or, rather, has infinite depth of field. As early as 2003 I had stumbled upon the foveon sensor, and the company's website, and I had read a bit about Faggin and the plan to sense colors, at depth, in silicon. I had, even, at this early time, looked a bit into the structure of the human retina and it struck me that the differential resolution with respect to visual angle, or retinal eccentricty, was a far more interesting aspect of the imaging system, than the particular methodology employed to sense color at every pixel, at near 100% fill factor (silicon senses dark and light, only, though, with higher energy photons, multiple hole-electron pairs per photon are generated, according to the equation " Ni = E (eV) / Ee-h, where ηi is the ideal quantum yield (electrons/interacting photon) and Ee-h is the energy required to generate an electron-hole pair, which for silicon is 3.65 eV/e− at room temperature." (Janesick).) It was some time later, perhaps 2005-2010, when I was studying Euclidean and Non-Euclidean systems, that I read an Encyclopedia Brittanica article about Apollonious of Perga, and I modified my "60 degree half-angle (120 degree full-angle) cone" diagram, to include a hyperbolic section of the floor. This image, below, is the basic idea devised. Hecht's values for near and far accomodation were only approximate, and age and illumination level dependent, but, were, as follows; Snear = 0.125 m , Smid = 0.5 m. , Sfar1 = 1 m. and Sfar2 = 3.0 m.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting link. https://www.wilbourhall.org/ . If you fumble around on that website, you will see, back in "my old stomping grounds", the Rhode Island of the early 2000s, while I was fighting nepotism and the death of the American Meritocracy, and, principally, trying to be heard on the subject of robotic and human eyes (and memes), the Brown Univeristy History of Mathematics Department was bumbling along, falling into disuse, and, eventually, folding from a lack of funding and "societal valuation". It is quite a story, and somewhat mirrors my own research, as I was beginning to look into Adelbert Ames (Ames and Proctor, and the founding of JOSA, The Journal of the American Optical Society; the source of many of of the papers for my early 2000s research into the functional optics of the human eye), Lunenberg's treatise on Non-Eucldiean Visual Space (which I disagree, moderately, with), and finally, G.H. Gliddon's "Optical Replica of the Human Eye". Additionally, as I studied electrical engineeering, and image sensors and integrated circuits, I saw what a rich history New England actually had, with Lilienfeld, G.W. Pickard, and Brown's own W.G. Cady. Furthermore, the warnings of F.E. Wright appear to have gone unheeded, perhaps not for the Second World War, but for subsequent events, after that, as it seems that the "Fairchilds" and the "Lands" and the "American Optical Incs" of the 21st century have let the optics manufacturing centers shift overseas again, with Germany making the laser (TRUMPF) and the fancy mirrors (Zeiss) while the Dutch (ASML) make the giant photolithography machines. Poor form, America! But, back in early 2000s, I was busy thinking about science and math and history, and seeing--guessing--what could possibly come next. I am certain I could have used a bit of instruction, from Brown or Dartmouth, on the history of combinatorics, as my new scientific law, Meyer's (Linguistic) Law, (discovered in October 2003, whilst I studied for the GRE !), could have used a little more support from my neighbors and colleagues.</p>

<br>
     <p style="color:Red;" align="left">9. The conic sections of Apollonious of Perga. (diagram from Wikipedia).</p>
<br>
<br>

<p> But I have digressed from the main. The two diagrams, above, illustrate what I later (circa 2007-2010) added after reading an Encyclopedia Brittanica a (CD-ROm 2006 ed.) article about Apollonious of Perga. The diagram depicting the estimation of the monocular cone shows the roughly planar ground intersecting a cone of monocular vision, and serveral shapoes of ideal object surfaces within the object field. I became, in this interrim period (2006-2010), familiar with the work of Aries Arditi and the "Volume Visual Field" and was curious about what sorts of visual acuities could be percieved by the functional, healthy, human eye, in the prime of its life (say, age 15 to 35). My study, primarily of Navarro et. al.'s 1985, JOSA paper, informed me regarding the specifics of accommodation, while Lorrin Rigg's work, a circa 1960 article (in Graham), directed me towards the 4 different notions of visual acuity, as physiology researchers have devised to study the pheonomenon. It was also in this time that I became acquainted with Clyde Oyster's work, though I was frustratingly limited by the distance to the library that held it, and a lack of on-line access. I also was apprised of the exitstence of Smith and Atchison's work on "The Optics of the Human Eye", but could not obtain a copy to even peruse for another 5 or 10 years. Nevertheless, I joined the local amateur telescope maker's group and learned how to shape glass, even if the mirrors were 50 times larger than the lenses that I wanted to shape. </p>

<p>So, in brief, the diagram above was meant to incorporate the 20 diopters of accommodation (14+ D ? I don't have my notes with me), via Oyster's careful work on the subject, and with Oyster's citation of Wertheim, and Lorrin Rigg's description of the types of visual acuity measurements, a sense of peripheral visaul acuity can be gleaned, and a further citation by Oyster, of the so-called "near-triad" of accommodation, vergence angle and pupil size, of Alpern and Smith, and, finally, with the knowledge proferred in Hugh Davson's "Physiology of the Eye', via Fincham?, the Depth-of-Field data could help to quantitfy the acuity measurments of a well-lit (daylight; photopic) human monocular eye, and I could begin to trace those values of the sizes of real, observable objects, in object space, through the lens and other optical media of the eye, and I could thus begin to try to trace them to the receptor spacings of the three types of cones, and the rods, as enumerated, and estimated, first by Osterberg, 1935 and subsequently by Curcio et . al. circa 1991. And that is one hell of a run-on sentence.... to be cleaned up later.  .... TO BE CONTINUED ..... (and edited... sorry so sloppy /grammar-error).  </p>

<p> My analysis, sadly, was never completed, but one day, might be. To skip to the end of the story (spoiler alert !), by the time I had proved to myself that all the things I wished to accomplish, could be accomplished by well-funded engineers, well, then, I had finally gained access, circa 2013, but increasingly in the period of 2015-2017, to the crucial papers, and when I could finally see what well-funded gorups were doing, I found that they had somewhat surpassed me, but also, had, miraculously, also missed the point entirely! Luckily, with folks like George Gilder leading the way, American science was "marked safe" from excellence, and historical continuity, and humanistic depth, wisdom, and  from technological proficiency and success.</p>

It seems musicians are capable of a lot of "firsts"? Perhaps my Olfactory sensor will be a similar first?</p>

Irving Adler "A New Look at Geomtetry" which, while ultimately unconvincing on the subject of the validity and usefulness of Non-Euclidean Geomtery, provided excellent and meticulous historical analysis, and even a pithy expalanation for why someone might WANT to utilize Non-Euclidian geomtery. The title of his chapter, or section, "Euclid Dethroned, Euclid Triumphant" was humouorous, but ultimately unsatisfying, to me. His work was largely welcomed by me, due to my legal and professional and financial difficulties , and it was nice to know that other person, living in Vermont (albeit, in a different age; McCarthyian age ! 1950s !) had similar run-ins with the illegitimate authorities in the Untided States. See my section on my later legal troubles (<p><a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Politics.html"> 6. Politics, Life, and Law</a><p> ), wherein, within my filed legal documents, I cited the poor treatment of Adler--the relevance by analogy, or identical cirscumstance, of our poor treatment--my colleague, separated in time and political leanings (both "Left", but, at quick glance, I am probably less socialist or communistic) in-exile.</p>
