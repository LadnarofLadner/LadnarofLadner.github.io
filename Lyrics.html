<p> 1.The Mere Thpught



The mere thought of 

fingertips run through

your hair

and gaze into

your eyes oh

I lose myself in you

dont deny this thing I do



and you 

I lost my cool and you

run from that blind fool

I give my all I do I

 to you I



relinquish control

play poker and fold

oh the cards have not been kind

but once I faltered

I failed to halt her

and tell her she

she should be mine</p>







<p>2. Roses Bloom



Hey Hey

Hey Hey

A sea of green

Opens up into everything



Hey Hey Hey

Oh No No No No

Sea salt spray and wild roses bloom and bloom and

I see your colors dancin wild around the room



Hey Hey

Hey Hey

Close your eyes and you can

feel the heat

close you mind and you can

hear it breathe



Hey Hey Hey

Oh No No No No

Oh what a dogs life is this

that we lead in spite of this</p>









<p>3. Lindsay Mae







lindsay Mae may I

see in you a verse of prose

or could I only

feel in you your hidden thorn



I know that I need you like

I never done before

but Im crawlin reachin searchin

tryin to meet my feet to floor



I find my thoughts wander to

your every breath and being

and my heart is a virgin

vergin upon the obscene</p>







<p>4. 



All our lives are steeped in Sin

and this world we're livin in 

filled up nearly to the brim

is there a hole that I can get sick in (dig in?)



He looks at the blackened sky

asks himself he wonders why

brothers take their brothers blood

and leave them dying in the mud</p>








<p>5.Water Drippin'



Oh I think its about time

that you and I should stand in line

and we could be so content



Water drippin all down her breast

the sea it glistens in her eyes

Water drippin all down her breast

???the sea it glistens in her eyes???</p>














<p>6. Stand By Me</p>





























<p>7. Angel



B D#m   E    F#





Oh my Angel Crashin Down

I see you Smile hold you close

and like a cold winter wind

Im nback afgain and





Bm A D F#



I wish that I was in your jead

and now Im wishin I was

 somebody else oh instead

oh Im too blame for all I



I know I cause you pain and

that much a I know

motion excludes

emotion exudes



O h my angel crashin down 

I dreamed I stole from you a kiss

 and like a fire from tbe flies

I look deep in your eyes





A million there

all a glow

I took the stars from the heavens  above

and placed them on a pedestal 

so none could view their  splendor full



Amd like a wave crashin down

I dreamed I stole  from you  a kiss

and like a fire from the sky

????????????</p>












<p>8. Bright Star



Bright star

wouldst I were as steadfast as though art

Not in lone

Splendour hung aloft in the night

Watching with ewternal lids apart

like natures patient sleepless eremite

moving waters on their priestlike task

of pure abolution on the earth's human shore

 anmd gazing on the new soft fallen mask

of snow upon the mountains and the moors



Bright Star

steadfast still unchangeable

pillowed upon 

my fair loves ripening breast

to feel forever the soft fall and swell

awake for ever in a sweet unrest



still still to hear her tender taken breath

and so live foreve or else swoon to death</p>

<p>Sunset Slow



I sat atop my perch and

watched the sunset slow (glopw)

My eyes, so content and my

intent unknown

 I marvel at the blue

 green and golden hue

 which slipping past the pink horizon

fell and grew



Un5til my blazing eyes could



bear the site no more sight



in envy struck it all

 downupon the floor

 and in my final act

 as if to spite the fact

 I will always think of you forever more



Goodbye sweet and sunny day

 my erreaosntno awake



 goodbye sweet and slumbering night

 never have I fajkelkd

 nodding offf at noon

 or waking with the moon

 or all those tiumes I swore to you

 that my heart did ache



Goodbye to the turing leve the night havs won

goodbye sweetest smelaling rose

 the times has come

 like all those dreams I drramed whren I was so naive

 Ive always

 have always been that weay beforte

 and will always be



 Illl stand all upon my own two feet X 2 (outro X5?)</p>







<p>Desiree





Oh, Oh,

You teach me to

be a man



Oh Oh

Desiree

Showin’ every

thing you can



Desiree, you’re so special

Desiree on the level?

Desiree, I could hold you

night or day



Oh Oh 

Desiree

In my eyes you

read my lies and

 

Oh Oh

Desiree

all this time on

the horizon



Desiree

watch the sunset

never see it

Desireee

I need your eyes, 

open



Oh Oh

Desiree

all this time spent 

fantasizin’



Oh Oh

Desiree

you know that you’re

 the only one for me



Oh Oh

Desiree

fantasizin’



Oh Oh

Desiree

 the only one for me</p>











<p>Sweet Blue eyes



In your eyes

I can feel it

all my heart

full of joy and 

heavy fear

waiting here

watching you

wanting only



sweet blue eyes

touch your face and

smell your hair

hold my gaze 

smile my way

treasure every day



*harp solo



*guitar instrumental verse</p>






<p>Unapproachable



You’re so unapproachable

my behavior’s uncoachable

and all those things I’d see in you

I’d hope to find those fantasies are true

I’d hope the fantasies are true



You know I 

long to see you 

and be in your arms

I see

that we’re

meant to be



You’re so unapproachable 

my behavior ‘s uncoachable

And all those things I used to do

would only make me think of you

only make me think of you



You’re so unapproachable

 My Behavior’s uncoachable

I find it hard to think it through

just how to make you feel me too

just how to make you feel me too

GIrl you know

I like

 Girl you know

I’m ......



You’re so unapproachable

My Behavior’s uncoachable

If I (you?) had to the time to think it through

I know you’d sing a different tune





You’re so unattainable

My position’s unchangeable

If I thought you’d had the faintest clue

I’d shove you in a hole

you’d be pigeonholed</p>





Kaleidoscope



She’s seein’ Yellow

Scared little fellow





*Chorus*

He lies

Up awake

Drifting to dreamland

her eyes he

cannot shake

from this his

memory





She’s seein’ Green

For you he’s keen

 but he

 would not share

 your love

 anywhere



*Chorus* 2



She’s seein’ Red

She’s bein fed

 lies from some guy

 he’;s left

 wonderin why



*Chorus* 3



He’s seein’ Blue

You knew it too

when you knew in his heart

 from the very start



*Chorus* 3



I could hold you in my arms

 and feel in you your arms 

 asubtle charms feel in you in your’

 I know its not

 what you thinks meant to be

 but I could see it oh so clearly

 (Is it cruel or

 is it nice

please dispense some

fine advice)



my friends they tell me

Did you take the line he gave

or are you in the middle babe

did you become 

another slave

 I’ll meet you in

 the middle babe

the promise land

all this time we’ve been spending
