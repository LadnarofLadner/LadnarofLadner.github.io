  <p>Five or Six Lawsuits? So many, I forget?
   
  <p>It seems so very insane to me: Had you asked a roomful of kindergartners in 1985 "Who wants to be a hard case?", I think the kids would put their hands down, with fireman and policeman still being in high demand. But 15-20 years into looking for my first career position after college, I decided I needed to get some real answrers from somebody who is forced to answer, under oath. </p>

    <p>Lawsuit #1 : Circa September-November 2019</p>
  
    <p>Lawsuit #2 : The first, re-submitted, and re-iterated, circa November 2019 </p>

    <p>Lawsuit #3 : Serving papers on the buttons who served me papers. Ultimately, a quickly abandoned suit, as I was driven from my home, for the crime of doing science and expecting paymebnt for my work.</p>
  
    <p>Lawsuit #4 : Sued the U.S. Governemnt from Canadian soil, as I was, at the time, seeking political asylum in that country. 2020-2022. </p>

    <p>Lawsuit #5 and Appeal, #6 : After being dragged back to U.S. soil, against moderate to nvoiciferous pritest, I was again abandoned and vilated and forced to sue to onbtain my payment. I further violated and denied even the dignity fo a court hearing, in violation of Seventh and Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>

  <p><a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/vermont/vtdce/5:2019cv00175/30882">Lawsuit # 1</a></p>

 <p><a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/washington/wawdce/2:2022cv00232/307828">Lawsuit # 4</a></p>

<p><a href="https://casetext.com/case/meyer-v-biden">Lawsuit # 5 and 6</a> but don't believe the ruling. It's 100% bogus, stonewalling. Civ. 23-00470 JMS-WRP  </p>

  <p> I am presently considering a Supreme Court filing to overturn the 5th and 6th lawsuits, but it will be a lot of work, for almost zero chance of success. I am also, presently, running for Congress (summer 2024) and since the ACLU has ZERO help for me (how can that be? My father went ot Vietneam? teh laws work for us, too, right? The constitution and free speech still apply to us, right?) this endeavor demands all of my time. Perhaps, win or lose, I will ressurect the suit, at my earliest convenience.
