  <p>Five or Six Lawsuits? So many, I forget?
   
  <p>It seems so very insane to me: Had you asked a roomful of kindergartners in 1985 "Who wants to be a hard case?", i think the kids would put their hands down, with fireman and policeman still being in high demand. But 15-20 years into looking for my first career position after college, I decided I needed to get some real answrers from somebody who is forced to answer, under oath. </p>

    <p>Lawsuit #1 : Circa September-November 2019</p>
  
    <p>Lawsuit #2 : The first, re-submitted, and re-iterated, circa November 2019 </p>

    <p>Lawsuit #3 : Serving papers on the buttons who served me papers. Ultimately, a quickly abandoned suit, as I was driven from my home, for the crime of doing science and expecting paymebnt for my work.</p>
  
    <p>Lawsuit #4 : Sued the U.S. Governemnt from Canadian soil, as I was, at the time, seeking political asylum in that country. 2020-2022. </p>

    <p>Lawsuit #5 and Appeal, #6 : After being dragged back to U.S. soil, against moderate to nvoiciferous pritest, I was again abandoned and vilated and forced to sue to onbtain my payment. I further violated and denied even the dignity fo a court hearing, in violation of Seventh and Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
