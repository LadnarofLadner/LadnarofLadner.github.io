     <p style="color:Black;">I was born in Plainfield, VT (Berlin, VT) on July 14th, 1980, Bastille Day, Woody Guthrie's, Matthew Lyon's and, also, Gerald Ford's birthday. Plainfield is about 45 miles north-northwest of Hanover, NH, and 1980 is some 25 years after the summer research conference on A.I. was undertaken, in 1956.</p>
