  <p style="color:Black;">THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN MY MUSIC AND FOR MAKING A PURCHASE FOR YOUR NEXT PROJECT.</p>

   <p style="color:Black;">Your best best is to send a letter, snail-mail styloe, to:<br>
  <br>
  Randall Meyer<br>
  General Delivery<br>
  Kea'au, HI, 96749 USA<br>
  <br>
  Slightly more reliable than my personal phone number is my e-mail : randallmeyer2000@yahoo.com, but please try to add "BUY SONG" or "RENT SONG" into the subject line, as my e-mail generally just fills with junk mail, and I can get opressed by the backlog of useless information.<br>
  <br> 
   Facebook is a possibility too, but I am not certain I know how to direct you to the proper Randall Meyer, as there are many of us out there. Look for the one from VT (or HI) or the one with a profile photo of a 30 year old on toip of Mt. Jefferson, NH.<br>
