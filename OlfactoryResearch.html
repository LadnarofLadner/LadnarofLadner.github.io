<p>This section last updated, today, 04 30 2025.<p>
 
     <p style="color:Black;">Its safe to say, that I have no time to fill in this section today (01/16/2025), and must return to it at some later date. Presently (2020-2025), this is the most active area of my research, with some beginnings and inklings in 2003, when I studied touch sensors (principally, through a Elo-touch website "history" page; archived at wayback machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030925043704/http://www.elotouch.com/">here</a>" or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031016152013/http://www.elotouch.com/company/History.asp">here</a>.), via their website, at that time, 2003, prior to their sale to Tyco electronics. My study of SAW touch sensors was always part of my consideration for "robot skin", since any <em>in silicio</em> testing of Meyer's (Linguistic) law (FYI : S = V * N^2) would require "transducers" for all of the "five" senses. Microphones and image sensors being relatively perfected over the previous century, this left only touch sensation (though it is in actuality a multi-variable, complex quantity, consisting of pain, pressure, itch, tickle, hot/cold and etc), and then olfactory and gustatory sensors (in this section, we will assume, while focussing on the DX (Digital Transformation, see Kuroda et. al. (2023) of olfactory impressions (See Locke or Hume), that any such transducer would similarly apply to taste sensation, since my olfactory transducers are designed, in their various instantiations, for liquid and gaseous anayltes, separately.) This early research (circa 2003), was sidelined, while I spent 2005-2006, and the period of 2007-2016, researching CCDs and CMOS image sensors, Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs), Focal Surface Arrays (FSAs, chiefly, via, Goldberg Polyhedra), and so, it wasn't until about 2011-2015 that I started to look at SAW sensors again. It was around this time that I started to see the references to their use as chemical sensors (Wohltjen and Desseny, 1979)<a href="#[9]">[9]</a>.</p>
     
     <p style="color:Black;">In 2022, I spent about 6 months in Coos Bay, OR, helping my father retire, and I would frequent the public library there, and the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, U of O campus, down by the beach in Charlestown. It was here that I found my first reference to Fiber Optic Image Conduit "micro-bead" arrays (I had acquired FOICs from a CT company, circa 2011 as a gift when I asked for some free samples to experiment with a FSA fiber optic field flattener, coupler to CCD or CMOS flat imagers). The article, by Walt (2011) was title "Artificial Noses". Walt, and his lab, were responsible, circa mid-late 1990s and early 2000s, for creating DNA micro-bead, micro-arrays, which greatly sped up the decoding of the human genome. It seemed, in 2011, he was poised to add a disruptive technology, again, this time in the field of olfactory sensation digitization. I quickly forgot this paper, after returning to VT in early 2012, and did not return to the crucial Walt paper until mid-2024.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">This brief narrative, is a bit disjointed, and perhaps out of order, but at least is a nice quick synopsis of the state of my ignorance, up until about 2020, regarding olfactory science. I had done some prepatory work in VT, ordering chemical catalogs with fragrance science in mind (showing the analyte, "ligand" centric focus of my studies), and I acquired a CRC "Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients" being discarded by UVM library (Vermont), but that was mostly wiped out in the legal troubles of 2019, and of 2020-present (see, for an account of the ruination of lab and library, winter 2019, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Politics.html"> 6. Politics, Life, and Law</a>). I have, since, made some significant progress (hypothetical progress ! Still no money for experiments !), here, in Hawaii, but face another hard deadline for the movement of my "lab" and "library" (such as they are, with zero financing !), this time, pronably to Australia. It is my firm hope that my ideas can be attempted in an environment more favorable to academic scholarhsip, amongst gentlemen and gentleladies, in a legally functional society, as opoposed to the one that I presently reside in.</p>


<p style="color:Black;">In Vancouver (2020-2022), I had some access to the UBC library, and found some papers concerning Walt's work, but not the same one from my 2011 notebook, from Coos Bay. That paper, was forgotten until about 2024. Also, in Vancouver I happened upon the ORDB genetic library (on-line; Yale and U texas Tech?) of olfactory proteins and genes. This website would prove crucial for my present course of action, as I will detail below... at some other date, since my library internet time is about run out !... like ? the 1970s? time-share?) .</p>
