<p>This section last updated, today, 05 01 2025.<p>
 
     <p style="color:Black;"> Presently (2020-2025), this is the most active area of my research, with some beginnings and inklings in 2003, when I studied touch sensors (principally, through a Elo-touch website "history" page; archived at wayback machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030925043704/http://www.elotouch.com/">here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031016152013/http://www.elotouch.com/company/History.asp">here</a>.), via their website, at that time, 2003, shortly after to their sale to Tyco electronics. My study of SAW touch sensors was always part of my consideration for "robot skin", since any <em>in silicio</em> testing of Meyer's (Linguistic) Law (FYI : S = V * N^2) would require "transducers" for all of the "five" senses, and concomitant data arrays, and or matrices, for the five senses (closely mirroring the concept of sense "impressions", as explicated by such Empiricist philosophers as Locke and Hume). Microphones and image sensors being relatively perfected over the previous century, this left only touch sensation (though it is, in actuality, a multi-variable, complex array of quantities, consisting of pain, pressure, itch, tickle, hot/cold and etc), and then olfactory and gustatory sensors (in this section, we will assume, while focussing on the DX ( DX = Digital Transformation--see Kuroda et. al. (2023) <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>--of olfactory "impressions"; See Locke <a href="#[4]">[4]</a>, or Hume <a href="#[5]">[5]</a>), that any such transducer would similarly apply to taste sensation, since my olfactory transducers are designed, in their various instantiations, for liquid and gaseous anayltes, separately.) This early research (circa 2003), was sidelined, while I spent 2005-2006, and the period of 2007-2016, researching CCDs and CMOS image sensors, Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) <a href="#[6]">[6]</a>, Focal Surface Arrays <a href="#[7]">[7]</a> (FSAs, chiefly, via, Goldberg Polyhedra <a href="#[8]">[8]</a>), Lens Design<a href="#[9]">[9]</a><a href="#[10]">[10]</a><a href="#[11]">[11]</a><a href="#[12]">[12]</a> and so, it wasn't until about 2011-2015 that I started to look at SAW sensors again. It was around this time that I started to see the references to their use as chemical sensors (Wohltjen and Desseny, 1979) <a href="#[13]">[13]</a><a href="#[14]">[14]</a>. My early researches, in 2003, of the brief history of Dr. Sam Hurst <a href="#[1]">[1]</a> and his company, had introduced me to 4 and 5 wire resistive technologies, capacitive technologies, and surface acoustic wave technologies. The early 2000s and 2010s saw some additional efforts in these areas, including the invention of multi-touch capacitive, and mutli-touch SAW, and, particularly, the invention of "Gorilla Glass", and the subeseqeunt ubiquity of these devices, after the rise of the smartphone (we would be remiss not to mention, here, the inevitable march of "progress", engendered by Moore's Law, and in particular, the invention and miniaturization and high bit-densities of primarily "Flash" NAND memories, but also, DRAM cells, as co-technologies, or "enablers".).</p>
     
<p style="color:Black;">In 2011, I spent about 9 months in Coos Bay, OR, helping my father retire, and I would frequent the public library there, and the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, U of O campus, down by the beaches in Charleston. It was here that I found my first reference to Fiber Optic Image Conduit (FOIC) "micro-bead" arrays (I had acquired FOICs from a CT company, circa 2011 as a gift, when I had asked for some free samples to experiment with a FSA fiber optic field flattener; a coupler to a CCD similar to that invented by William Hicks<a href="#[15]">[15]</a>, as discussed by Jeff Hecht<a href="#[16]">[16]</a>, or, more specifically, to my possibly couple to my Kodak CMOS flat imagers, or FPA 9-sensor array). The article, by Walt (2011)<a href="#[17]">[17]</a> was titled "Artificial Noses". Walt, and his lab, were responsible, circa mid-late 1990s and early 2000s, for creating DNA micro-bead, micro-arrays, which greatly sped up the decoding of the human genome. It seemed, in 2011, he was poised to add a disruptive technology, again, this time in the field of olfactory sensation digitization (Olfactory DX). I quickly forgot this paper, after returning to VT in early 2012, and did not return to the crucial Walt paper until mid-2024.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">This brief narrative, is a bit disjointed, and perhaps out of order, but at least is a nice quick synopsis of the state of my ignorance, up until about 2020, regarding olfactory science. I had done some prepatory work in VT, ordering chemical catalogs with fragrance science in mind (showing the analyte, "ligand" centric focus of my studies), and I acquired a CRC "Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients" being discarded by UVM library (Vermont), but that was mostly wiped out in the legal troubles of 2019, and of 2020-present (see, for an account of the ruination of lab and library, winter 2019, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Politics.html"> 6. Politics, Life, and Law</a>). I have, since, made some significant progress (hypothetical progress ! Still no money for experiments !), here, in Hawaii, but face another hard deadline for the movement of my "lab" and "library" (such as they are, with zero financing !), this time, probably to Australia. It is my firm hope that my ideas can be attempted in an environment more favorable to academic scholarhsip, amongst gentlemen and gentleladies, in a legally functional society, as opoposed to the one that I presently reside in.</p>


<p style="color:Black;">In Vancouver (2020-2022), I had some access to the UBC library, and found some papers concerning Walt's work, but not the same paper from my 2011 notebook, from Coos Bay. That paper, was forgotten until about 2024. Also, in Vancouver I happened upon the ORDB genetic library (on-line, <a href="https://ordb.biotech.ttu.edu/ORDB/info/humanorseqanal">here</a>; Yale and U texas Tech?) of olfactory proteins and genes. This website would prove crucial for my present course of action, and the links to the Weizmann Institute data (as well as the ORDB comparison to the other 3 or 4 labs compiling this data, in the early-oughts, 00's) are especially useful. Now, 10 or 20 years later, the NIH websites, ENSEMBL and BLAST, are of inestimable value, and a few other, though my head, to be entirely honest, "swims" with this overabundance of data. But, as we will see, directly below, it is OK to be confused, when the science is shifting this quickly, and since the early 2020s there has been significant discoveries and additions of datasets in the community studying the human genome, changes for which I am optimistic that I can catch up, and pull astride my colleagues of a "parallel-discipline" bent. .</p>

<p style="color:Black;">OK, now, with preliminaries out of the way, and an exposition of what I knew, and when I knew it, we can proceed with a proper explanation of (A) what the field has presently discovered, and (B) what I can possibly have to offer as an extension. Needless to say, I have not engaged in empirical study, and can only hypothesize new avenues, and try to nail down the types of industrial or manufacturing processes wthat will lead to a practicable, anthropomorphic (anthropofunctional), multi-array, olfactory transducer. I have focussed on three primary technologies (SAW, FOIC, and CCD), in large part because of my familiarity with these fields, but also because they have been studied the longest and are well characterized systems. However, as an "outsider" viewing the "sexy science" from afar--and often eschewing its more plainly partisan proponents .. ... </p>
