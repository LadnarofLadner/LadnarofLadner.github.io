<p>This section last updated, today, 05 01 2025.<p>
 
     <p style="color:Black;"> Presently (2020-2025), this is the most active area of my research, with some beginnings and inklings in 2003, when I studied touch sensors (principally, through a Elo-touch website "history" page; archived at wayback machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030925043704/http://www.elotouch.com/">here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031016152013/http://www.elotouch.com/company/History.asp">here</a>.), via their website, at that time, 2003, shortly after to their sale to Tyco electronics. My study of SAW touch sensors was always part of my consideration for "robot skin", since any <em>in silicio</em> testing of Meyer's (Linguistic) Law (FYI : S = V * N^2) would require "transducers" for all of the "five" senses, and concomitant data arrays, and or matrices, for the five senses (closely mirroring the concept of sense "impressions", as explicated by such Empiricist philosophers as Locke and Hume). Microphones and image sensors being relatively perfected over the previous century, this left only touch sensation (though it is, in actuality, a multi-variable, complex array of quantities, consisting of pain, pressure, itch, tickle, hot/cold and etc), and then olfactory and gustatory sensors (in this section, we will assume, while focussing on the DX ( DX = Digital Transformation--see Kuroda et. al. (2023) <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>--of olfactory "impressions"; See Locke <a href="#[4]">[4]</a>, or Hume <a href="#[5]">[5]</a>), that any such transducer would similarly apply to taste sensation, since my olfactory transducers are designed, in their various instantiations, for liquid and gaseous anayltes, separately.) This early research (circa 2003), was sidelined, while I spent 2005-2006, and the period of 2007-2016, researching CCDs and CMOS image sensors, Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) <a href="#[6]">[6]</a>, Focal Surface Arrays <a href="#[7]">[7]</a> (FSAs, chiefly, via, Goldberg Polyhedra <a href="#[8]">[8]</a>), Lens Design<a href="#[9]">[9]</a><a href="#[10]">[10]</a><a href="#[11]">[11]</a><a href="#[12]">[12]</a> and so, it wasn't until about 2011-2015 that I started to look at SAW sensors again. It was around this time that I started to see the references to their use as chemical sensors (Wohltjen and Desseny, 1979) <a href="#[13]">[13]</a><a href="#[14]">[14]</a>. My early researches, in 2003, of the brief history of Dr. Sam Hurst <a href="#[1]">[1]</a> and his company, had introduced me to 4 and 5 wire resistive technologies, capacitive technologies, and surface acoustic wave technologies. The early 2000s and 2010s saw some additional efforts in these areas, including the invention of multi-touch capacitive, and mutli-touch SAW, and, particularly, the invention of "Gorilla Glass", and the subeseqeunt ubiquity of these devices, after the rise of the smartphone (we would be remiss not to mention, here, the inevitable march of "progress", engendered by Moore's Law, and in particular, the invention and miniaturization and high bit-densities of primarily "Flash" NAND memories, but also, DRAM cells, as co-technologies, or "enablers".).</p>
     
<p style="color:Black;">In 2011, I spent about 9 months in Coos Bay, OR, helping my father retire, and I would frequent the public library there, and the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, U of O campus, down by the beaches in Charleston. It was here that I found my first reference to Fiber Optic Image Conduit (FOIC) "micro-bead" arrays (I had acquired FOICs from a CT company, circa 2011 as a gift, when I had asked for some free samples to experiment with a FSA fiber optic field flattener; a coupler to a CCD similar to that invented by William Hicks<a href="#[15]">[15]</a>, as discussed by Jeff Hecht<a href="#[16]">[16]</a>, or, more specifically, to my possibly couple to my Kodak CMOS flat imagers, or FPA 9-sensor array). The article, by Walt (2011)<a href="#[17]">[17]</a> was titled "Artificial Noses". Walt, and his lab, were responsible, circa mid-late 1990s and early 2000s, for creating DNA micro-bead, micro-arrays, which greatly sped up the decoding of the human genome. It seemed, in 2011, he was poised to add a disruptive technology, again, this time in the field of olfactory sensation digitization (Olfactory DX). I quickly forgot this paper, after returning to VT in early 2012, and did not return to the crucial Walt paper until mid-2024.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">This brief narrative, is a bit disjointed, and perhaps out of order, but at least is a nice quick synopsis of the state of my ignorance, up until about 2020, regarding olfactory science. I had done some prepatory work in VT, ordering chemical catalogs with fragrance science in mind (showing the analyte, "ligand" centric focus of my studies), and I acquired a CRC "Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients" being discarded by UVM library (Vermont), but that was mostly wiped out in the legal troubles of 2019, and of 2020-present (see, for an account of the ruination of lab and library, winter 2019, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Politics.html"> 6. Politics, Life, and Law</a>). I have, since, made some significant progress (hypothetical progress ! Still no money for experiments !), here, in Hawaii, but face another hard deadline for the movement of my "lab" and "library" (such as they are, with zero financing !), this time, probably to Australia. It is my firm hope that my ideas can be attempted in an environment more favorable to academic scholarhsip, amongst gentlemen and gentleladies, in a legally functional society, as opoposed to the one that I presently reside in.</p>


<p style="color:Black;">In Vancouver (2020-2022), I had some access to the UBC library, and found some papers concerning Walt's work, but not the same paper from my 2011 notebook, from Coos Bay. That paper, was forgotten until about 2024. Also, in Vancouver I happened upon the ORDB genetic library (on-line, <a href="https://ordb.biotech.ttu.edu/ORDB/info/humanorseqanal">here</a>; Yale and U texas Tech?) of olfactory proteins and genes. This website would prove crucial for my present course of action, and the links to the Weizmann Institute data (as well as the ORDB comparison to the other 3 or 4 labs compiling this data, in the early-oughts, 00's) are especially useful. Now, 10 or 20 years later, the NIH websites, ENSEMBL and BLAST, are of inestimable value, and a few other, though my head, to be entirely honest, "swims" with this overabundance of data. But, as we will see, directly below, it is OK to be confused, when the science is shifting this quickly, and since the early 2020s there has been significant discoveries and additions of datasets in the community studying the human genome, changes for which I am optimistic that I can catch up, and pull astride my colleagues of a "parallel-discipline" bent. .</p>

<p style="color:Black;">OK, now, with preliminaries out of the way, and an exposition of what I knew, and when I knew it, we can proceed with a proper explanation of (A) what the field has presently discovered, and (B) what I can possibly have to offer as an extension. Needless to say, I have not engaged in empirical study, and can only hypothesize new avenues, and try to nail down the types of industrial or manufacturing processes wthat will lead to a practicable, anthropomorphic (anthropofunctional), multi-array, olfactory transducer. I have focussed on three primary technologies (SAW, FOIC, and CCD), in large part because of my familiarity with these fields, but also because they have been studied the longest and are well characterized systems. However, as an "outsider" viewing the "sexy science" from afar--and often eschewing its more plainly partisan proponents .. ... </p>

<p style="color:Red;">THIS SECTION ADDED : 05 16 2025</p>
<p style="color:Black;">So, much interesting work has occured, here, in Hawaii, since my October 2022 move from Vancouver, CA. Upon turning 40 y.o. (2020), and moving from the East Coast, under the worst possible circumstances, I had decided to give myself 10 years to crack the "Olfactory transducer" problem. My work in optics, though not completely finished, was largely succesful, though at a decided lull, and at least and it seemed like a good time to move on, since much of my optical and electronics laboratory was confiscated and ruined by troglodytic philistines. In Hawaii, after a few unseuccessful forays into the working world, I decided to run for Congress again (2024), and finish up my technoopoly game design (90-99% done; ready to play and game test!), and even learn to coide a bit of python, in the hopes of coding technopoly for release on the internet, or maybe even a commercial software deal (to fund my both frugal lifetstyle and my lavish scientific proclivities and propensities!). I got heavily involved in olfactory research, and posited a structure for an olfactory bitmap, complete with "magic numbers" ("BO", in hex, as I recall?) for the file format, and a "purloining" of Unicode Hex values. Shortly after this bold and hasty manuever, I posted the bitmap and unicode "code points" to this present github page (iun its own respository; circa April-May 2023, if I recall correctly?). That summer, 2023, I believe I began to study microfluidics and concieve of my olfactory shutter design, for wafer scale devices, and of the shuttering of saturated devices and the opening of unused ones. The freehand drawn picture, above, has a date of April/May 2024, by which time I had a fairly advanced conception of how the wafer-scale, hermetically-sealed device would work. I believe, about March 2024 I had come across the paper that utilized bovine and porcine (cow and pig) Olfactory Binding Proteins (OBPs) in SAW devices, and that jogged my memory about my earlier--albeit lame and quickly aborted--attempt to understand the Yale/Texas-Tech, ORDB wbepage, back when I was in Vancouver, circa 2021 (at least, sometime between October 2020 and October 2022). So, turning back towards these biological questions, and away from a rather boring search for suitable polymer layers for SAWs and/or for any new and interesting chemically fluorescing reactants for FOICS, I was hapilly surprised when I found the Nanodisc hORG/hORP studies, circa May and June of 2024. After a year of study of quartz etching in certain crystal planes with HF, and of microfluidic Quake valves, and Tesla Valves, and Venturi pumps, and other associated technologies, it was a welcome change of pace to flip to a pureley bio-chemical approach that appears more likely to mimic the actual human olfactory apparatus, about whose function, we still have so many questions. So, in summary to this lengthy diatribe and scientific, memoir-style rant, the Goldsmith nanodisc ORG/ORP (muscarine) paper was a crucial find, as was the Adrenergic GPCR Lamichhane study. And when I happened upon Kuroda et. al. (2023) <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>, circa September to December 2024, though it was slow to dawn on me to read it carefully, and throoughly, by this time I could recognize it for what it was. The first functional transducer to use all approx. 400 hORGs/hORPs in a functiional multiarray senors! I was a bit bummed that somebody beat me to the finish line (again; due to my lack of fiunding and lack of reputation, or undeserved bad reputation!), since they had published right around the time I was posting on this github repository about "borrowing" (stealing) unicode code-points and making a software standard and specification that would fit the kind of data that I KNEW a new, properly designed, olfactory transducer would eventually produce. Kuroda et. al. used live cells, and imaged the Ca+ ion flux via labelled fluorescent molecules, and this has many advantages, but one particular disadvantage is the eventual death of the cells, typically, in 3 to 5 days. Nanodsics might have shelf lives measured in weeks, or months. So, luckily, for me, it seems, as of today (05 16 2025), as far as I know, nobody has done the approx. 400 hORG/hORP nanodisc study that should be done, in order to supply my olfactory bitmap with digital data for each of the unicode "code-points" that I have assigned to it. The closest I have seen, besides Kuroda, seems to be a Boellinger (sp?) et. al. study, wherein they attempt to grow the 400 hORPs by finding "consensus" sequences for four different hORP "families", in order to aid in the chaperoning and construction in the endoplasmsmic retilculum and their ultimate placement in measursable quanitities in the cell membrane. This difficulty had previously hampered the effective study of these diverse, approx. 400 proteins; Boellinger et. al. elegantly sought to address this. One final note, in this screed, is that I have been thinking alot about James Janesick's CCD book "Scientific Charge Coupled Devices", and how fortuitous it was that I read that work, as early, and often, as I did, in my life. Sometime, whilst running for office, here in Hawaii (I was passing out fliers circa May 2024 through asbout September 2024) I came upon the idea that a Back Illuminated CCD structure might be ideal for capturing of an "olfactory image" or even "olfactory video", through "olfixels", with an overlayed "olfactory filter array", analogous to a color filter array, as found in silicon-vision image sensors. Janesick's book breaks the capturing process of an image down into 4 steps, to which, if I adapot it to olfaction, perhaps in a section below this one, I will probably add a fifth step, in the beginning. Janesick (2001) says it is (1) Charge Generation, (2) Charge Collection, (3) Charge Transfer, and (4) Charge Measurement. I will leave the rest of this discussion for another time, when i have more precise and accurate notes to giuide my construction of these descriptions. I will provide a more detailed accounting of these bibliographic items mentioned, above, at some later, more convenient date.</p>
