<p>Far-Left : I am first and foremost, above all things, a scientist. Next, in no particular order, I am a musician, a semi-amateur historian of science, and of philosophy, a self-taught electrical engineer, self-taught optical engineer, self taught roboticist,  a somewhat reluctant philosopher, a fairly reluctant poet, and, now, I am somewhat begrudgingly, a politician and possibly, someday in the near future, I will become an adequate to exemplary statesman. As a scientst, I often tell people, I possess the best of both worlds: the courage creativity and perspicacity to invent, imagine, and hypothesize "the new"--the "liberal", or progressive, if you will--while simultaneously, being held to the standards of the past, the knowledge already gained, both theoretical and purely empirical, and in this sense, I am bound to conservative traditions as well. This is my explanation for being both "Independent", as in my run for Congress in Vermont back in 2014, and, now, in this present run in the second district of Hawaii, 2024, primary (EDIT: as of August 10, 2024, qualified for the November General Election! Thanks for your support!), as  a "Nonpartisan". If there were a "Scientist" party, I would most assuredly join ! <\p>
