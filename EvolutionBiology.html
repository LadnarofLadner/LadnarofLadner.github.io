   <p style="color:Black;">I attended the University of Rhode Island from September 1998, through a summer semester (necessary to clean up a few pre-requisite courses), in August of 2002. On August 22nd (or 23rd?) I was issued a Bachelor of Science degree, in the field of Marine Biology, but by about my third year, on full-tuition shcoalrship in the marine biology program, I had already turned to important questions concerning cultural evolution and memetic science (inchoate, and in its infncy), and to the digital sciences that dovetailed so nicely with the bioinformatic perspective, then (and now) in vogue.</p>

  <p style="color:Black;">Since age 14, my aunt, who works in the environmental science and education fields in marine science, had advised that a graduate degree was necessary for doing serious work in any scientific field, and so, there was little question regarding my future prospects in the working world, and in academia. It was always my plan to study for, and recieve, at least a Master's degree, and, quite probably, a Ph.D. Having been introduced to the works of Stephen Jay Gould (especially his book on the Burgess Shale, "Wonderful Life", 1989), and to "memes" (Dawkins, 1976, "The Selfish Gene"), and to Daniel Dennett's book "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" (1995), and, thusly, to Chomsky's "Syntactic Structutes" (and his "New Horizons on Language", and Philip Lieberman's "Human Language and Our Reptilian Brains"), I was, thus, primed for serious thought on the subject of syntax and semantics, and their relative impirtance to the provess of evolving culture; rather, we shall loosley define as, "change in culture, over time". And so, in the Fall of 2003, after a short gap year (mortgage application processing, as a temporary employee), I was looking to enter Tufts "Masters-Only" program, which they billed as a prepatory program for the "Ivy League" Philosophy Ph.D degree programs. Whilst studying for the GRE exam, I stumbled across the review equations for combinations and permutations, and was struck by their importance for Combinatorial Linguistics, Syntax, and Semantics; and, essentially, pointing, by analogy, to the Mendellian "Punnett Square' and "Law of Independent Assortment" for memes, instead of genes. And so, mid-October, 2003, I derived the equation VN^2 = S, describing the maximum number of intelligble "Simple Semantic Sentences" that can be constructed by any intelligence, Natural or Artificial, that is in possession of N number of Nouns and V number of verbs, and adhering to one of the six main "types" of lingusitic typology, namely, SOV, SVO, OVS, OSV, VSO, VOS (With the verb list supplying the V of a sentence, and the noun list providing semantic referents for the Subjects (S) and Objects (O) of a simple-semantic-sentence, S). </p>

<p style="color:Black;">I have bent all thoughts of graduate school, employment, book writing, miniatuyre personally funded experiments, self-funded library research, and even politics and law, towards the end of developing this hypothesis, testing it, in silicio, especially, and publishing it in reputable journals and discussing it with reputable colleagues ina na advanced academic envirnment, with little luck (to date, 2025), I am sorry to say.</p>

<p style="color:Black;">Please see the following links, for attempts I have bent towards establishing Hume's (and Locke and Berkeley's) concepts of "impression" and "ideas", iontoa  theoretical framework and context, testable, in silicio, and, possibly , applicable in other fields, in vitro or in situ.</p>
