 <p style="color:Black;">The mere thought of<br>
Fingertips run through<br>
your hair<br>
and gaze into<br>
your eyes ohhh<br>
I lose myself in you<br>
donâ€™t deny, thus thing I do<br>
<br>
And you---<br>
I lost my cool<br>
And you---<br>
run from that blind fool---<br>
I gave my all (heart?)
I do I, to you, I--<br>
   
A passion strikes me<br>
a moment froze in time<br>
dont deny me<br>
my desire<br>
and spend the night here<br>
lie be4soide me for a touch<br>
or for a time<br>
or for a time<br>
<br>
And you---<br>
I lost my cool<br>
And you---
run from that blind fool---<br>
I gave my all (heart?)
I do I, to you, I--<br>
<br>
relinquish control<br>
play poker and fold<br>
oh the cards<br>
have not been kind<br>
but once I faltered<br>
I failed to halt her<br>
and tell her she<br>
she should be mine<br>
<br>
and tell her she she<br>
she should be mine<br>
