  <p>I derived Meyer's Law (Meyer's Lingusitic Law, not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer%27s_law">Meyer's Law (hardness)</a>) from the permutation and combination equations, namely , n! and [n!/((n-r)! * r!)] , in the autumn of 2003, as I studied for the GRE exam. It immediately suggested itself as a piece of companion logic to Chomsky's poverty of stimulus and universal grammar arguments, and, perhaps more metaphgoricallly, as a sort of "Linguistic Punnett Square", or DNA, "binary code"; a code for constructing culture.</p>
