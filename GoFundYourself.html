<p style="color:Black;">P.S. I am still developing "BEST PRACTICES" as "selling my music" is a very new process to me (even at age 44 !).

I assume, some form of "Copyleft" license will be sisued. If youn read, above, you will see that short clips may be freely enjoyted, and youtube full songs and performances can be scraped from the internet and used, probably without repercusssions. But I would be amnnoyed. Please pay if you use morte than 30 seconds or a 1 minute clip in your movie. These are good "mooid setters"; good tunes. Pay for quality ! As intimated above, I can probably be enticed inyto a sound studio setting, or provoked into re-recording, either informally, oir semi-formally, for a decent privce. Let's haggle. But my time is money. PICK A GOOD SONG ! Cuz I actually enjoy re-recording my older songs, if they are escpeically good, and clever and c atchy. Thanks again for listening, anbd buying.

This is kind of what "Copyleft" looks like". I guess I pretty much give freedoms 10 and 1 away, but 2 and 3, you should probably pay for it.
