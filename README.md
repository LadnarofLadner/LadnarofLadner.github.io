<p>Thank you for navigating to my page, and thanks, in advance, for your support. Here is a little bit of biographical infomrmation about me. I am so far Left I fell off the American politcal scale, sometime around 1996-2000. I was born in Plainfield, Vermont, and grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island (1988-2004). I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology from the University of Rhode Island, on a full tuition scholarship. After 2004, I moved back to Plainfield, Vermont,in search of graduate school [sootioons and siucentific work, where I remained, waiting, patiently, until about 2014, when I ran for Congress, and debated Rep. Peter Welch (D., now Senator), and others, on Vermont Public Television. Despite my sincere reservations about the direction the country was going in, my warnings, apparently, went unheeded, and I remain under-utilized and un-utilized, in our modern economy. This is a poisionous economy. Period, full stop.</p>

<p>When I claim to be far-Left, I should be a bit more specific. It ias more accurate to call me extremely  progressive, though, due to some professional proclivities and phislosophical predilections, proigressive" must be understood ina  somewhat limited sense. I am, however, emphatically not Socialist or Communist, though I do not shruink from the labels as I find the perjorative to be a dull and dimwitted , and outdated one. I am, however, a full-throated supportwer of cimmunity and society, which share the root words of the dreaded "-isms", but I also support,and enjoy, capital, the root-word for the other "boogetyman" of modern politics, "capitaluism". Here I part with many "Liberqals" who often assume that possession of "capital" or prfoession of ideas which support creation of value which involves use of capital, is somehow "selling out". Money, like community and society, is an OK thing tio value; it is the elevation of these things to "-isms", rei-ified to God-like or religious status, that concerns me, most.</p>
