  <p> I was born in 1980, in Berlin, Vermont, and spent the first 8 years of my life in nearby Plainfield, Vermont, home of Goddard College, sometimes Bernie Sanders, and the "Hippie" psychedelic-jam-band, Phish. In 1988 I moved to Warwick Rhode Island and completed my education at Tollgate High School, in 1998, and thereafter, at University of Rhode Island in 2002 (Marine Biology, B.S. 08/22/2002).</p>
