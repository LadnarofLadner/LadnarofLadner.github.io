  <p> I was born in 1980, in Berlin, Vermont, and spent the first 8 years of my life in nearby Plainfield, Vermont, home of Goddard College, and the sometimes environs and haunts of ol' Bernie Sanders, and birhtplace of the "Hippie" psychedelic-jam-band, Phish. My father and mother moved there, circa 1978, in a late wave of the "balkc-to-the-land" movement, and my father was a  bass guitarisyt in moderately successful rock band, the Zucchinni Borthers, with lead singer and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Conoscenti">Don Conoscenti</a>.  In 1988 I moved to Warwick Rhode Island and completed my education at Tollgate High School, in 1998, and thereafter, at University of Rhode Island in 2002 (Marine Biology, B.S. 08/22/2002).</p>

  <p>How did I become an optical engineer?</p>

  <p>How did I become a politician?</p>

  <p>Why did I forget to (a) earn money, (*b) "get a job", (c) buy a house, (d) buy a car, (e) "get a haircut and get a real job", (f) find a girlfriend/wife and have kids?</p>

   <p>Why do I do all these jobs, for no money? Am I stupid, or just incompetent? Or am I a slave?</p>
