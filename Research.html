  <p> I suppose, it all began with Darwinism, or, rather, late 20th century Neo-Darwinism, and morphed, slowly, into more empirical directions. While still an undergraduate, perhaps in my sophpomore or junior year, my passing familiarity with "memes" as a theoretical, excplanatory device, led to an intense interest in "cultural evolution", and, by extension, to the intricacies of the very separate, yet complimetary, mechanisms of cultural and organic evolution. I was perhaps a pedantic "stickler", seeking to add complexity to the simplified version of the Hardy-Weinberg Equillibrium, as it was then taught to undergraduates, and in the advanced courses of the public secondary schools. But I was, also, quite mindful of the very good reasons to amend 50 years of carefully couched theoretical and ethical commitments, namely, specifically, the post-WWII consensus regarding racism, ethnocentrism, imperialism and genetic determinism (i.e. the nature vs. nurture debate).  In the Fall of 2003, while studying for the GRE exam, my review stumbled across the equations for permutations and combinations, which suggested to me (after a few choice and interesting conversations about LISP, high level languages, and assembly and machine language with my high school buddy, Joe) Meyer's Law, which, ever after, has been my goal, in pursuing a PhD degree, so that I might be allowed to develop and advance my theory about Universal Grammar (via thoughts similar to Chomsky, Dennett, Gould, and Dawkins). </p>
