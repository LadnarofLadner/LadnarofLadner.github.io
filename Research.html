  <p> I suppose, it all began with Darwinism, or, rather, late 20th century Neo-Darwinism, and morphed, slowly, into more empirical directions. While still an undergraduate, perhaps in my sophomore or junior year, my passing familiarity with "memes" as a theoretical, explanatory device, led to an intense interest in "cultural evolution", and, by extension, to the intricacies of the very separate, yet complimentary, mechanisms of cultural and organic evolution. I was perhaps a pedantic "stickler", seeking to add complexity to the simplified version of the Hardy-Weinberg Equillibrium, as it was then taught to undergraduates, and in the advanced courses of the public secondary schools. But I was, also, quite mindful of the very good reasons to very cautiously amend the 50 years of carefully couched theoretical and ethical commitments, namely, specifically, the post-WWII consensus regarding racism, ethnocentrism, imperialism and genetic determinism (i.e. the nature vs. nurture debate).  In the Fall of 2003, while studying for the GRE exam, my review stumbled across the equations for permutations and combinations, which suggested to me (after a few choice and interesting conversations about LISP, high level languages, and assembly and machine language with my high school buddy, Joe) Meyer's Law, which, ever after, has been my goal, in pursuing a PhD degree, so that I might be allowed to develop and advance my theory about Universal Grammar (via thoughts similar to Chomsky, Dennett, Gould, and Dawkins). </p>

    <p>Another train of thought I had followed in my undergraduate tenure, in my junior year, involved the work of Paul Thompson, and by extension, the entire philosophy of biology community of the mid to late 1980s. Specificallym, his book "The Structure of Biologhicalb nTheories" was quite important, to me, though, to this day, still only dimly understood. the importance of his work, and Lloy'd and Rosenberg's, and Hull and Ruse's,a nd E.H. Mercer, and Gould's, shoyuld not be undersetimated. In fact, in tracing it to its roots, one finds oneself knee-deep in early tio mid-20th century philiosophy, proper, and hagglnig with the likes of Bertrand Russell, Charles Sanders Peirce, j.H. Woodger, Alfred Tarski, and Richard Semon. At its fundament, Thompson intimates, the theory sturcture of biology, and the other sciences and mathematics, and knowledge in general, should conform to one of two styles or modes: the Syntactoic Constriuctuin, or the Semantic Construction. I lean toward the Syntactic concpetion, and, operhapds, Russel's abandaonded axiomatic forumlations for all knowledge, and trust a bit, that j.H. Woodger made some good headway on the subjewct. Of particular mention is probably Msary B Williams axiomatization of Natural Selection, circa 1970s. I would indeed like to read and write about this topic, in a supervised, university setting. </p>

    <p> In the autumn of 2003, after six months temnporary work in a dismal mortgage branch, at a local credit union, I set up shop at the local library, looking for real work in the real sciences. I did not find such, but did begin to think seriously about how I would test Meyer's Law, and constructing Strong A.I. seemed to be a wonderful proposdition. I was fooling around a bit with breadboards, and learning all that I could about semiconductor physics, so, when I happened upon the company Foveon Inc., their unique method of color sensing in image snsors, and the previoius work of Federico Faggin, I was on my way to two or three decades of work in anthropomorphic, anthropo-functional, transducer design.</p>
