 <p style="color:Black;">Oh my angel crashin’ down,<br>
See you smile, hold you close<br>
Like a cold winter wind,<br>
I’m back again and,<br>
I wish that I was, in your head<br>
Now I’m wishin’ I was<br>
Somebody else instead<br>
 I’m to blame for all I <br>
 I know I cause you pain<br>
that much I know<br>
Motion exudes, emotion excludes<br>
And like a wave crashin’ down<br>
I dreamed I stole from you a kiss<br>
and like a fire from the flies<br>
I look deep in your eyes<br>
a million there all aglow<br>
I took the stars form the heavens above<br>
and placed them on a pedestal<br>
So none could view their splendor, full<br>
Every time I call you,<br>
you’re not at home,<br>
you call me back but,<br>
with a spin you ask for him</p>
