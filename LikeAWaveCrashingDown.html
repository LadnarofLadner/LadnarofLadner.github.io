 <p style="color:Black;">Oh my angel crashin’ down,
See you smile, hold you close
Like a cold winter wind,
I’m back again and,
I wish that I was, in your head
Now I’m wishin’ I was
Somebody else instead
 I’m to blame for all I 
 I know I cause you pain
that much I know
Motion exudes, emotion excludes
And like a wave crashin’ down
I dreamed I stole from you a kiss
and like a fire from the flies
I look deep in your eyes
a million there all aglow
I took the stars form the heavens above
and placed them on a pedestal
So none could view their splendor, full
Every time I call you,
you’re not at home,
you call me back but,
with a spin you ask for him</p>
