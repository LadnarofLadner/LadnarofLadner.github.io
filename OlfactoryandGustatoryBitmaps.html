      <p style="color:Red;">Free hand diagram of wafer scale, hermetically sealed, and microfluidic shuttered, SAw and FOIC, liuquid and gas samople, hORG/hORP-analog olfactory and / or gustatory transducers. "Rainbows"--colors--indicate the unknown polymers and /or proteins that, hopefully, act in analoglous fashion to the functioning human animal.</p>

      <p style="color:Red;">Unicode values appropriated and assigned to ORDB (Yale and Texas Tech., webhost) consensus names, based upon four DNA, human genetic coding labs, and upon the Olfactory Receptor Gene and Protein data they've obtained. Any Massively-Parallel, Anthropoid, Wafer-Scale Olfactory and Gustatory Sensor will most likely be a hybrid technology of inorganic, electro-cehmical sensors and a suitable series--gamut--of organic sensing films. It would probably be most advisable to utilize the organic chemicals that are most closely analogous to the in situ, in vivo proteins, as utilized by the human animal. At the very least, absorptive polymers would be used, but a more closer analog would be e coli grown proteins and "nanodisc"-platformed, seven transmemberane G-coupled proteins, as occurs in the fucntional human animal.</p>

      <p style="color:Red;"> Olfactory bitmaps are probably somewhat unecessary, since the bitstream will have light bandwidth requirements, and it might make more sense to have a time averaged sampling, or a continuous bitstream of real-time olfactory data. It seems obvious that a container fomrat like .mp4 could easily carry the olfactory data along, parallel to the visual, auditory, and text data, but, in the interest of real-time streaming and processing, my particular immplementation of Strong A.I. might abandon .mp4 encoding, due to its sub-sampling band-width priorities. A streaming format might be more approrpiate for real-time processing, of visual, and other data streams.</p>
