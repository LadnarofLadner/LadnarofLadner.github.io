<p style="color:black;">Thank you for navigating to my page, and thanks, in advance, for your support. Here is a little bit of <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Biography.html">biographical</a> and practical (political, philsophical) information about me. Though the ballot reads <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Nonpartisan.html">"Nonpartisan"</a>, I am so <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Far-Left.html">Far-Left</a> that I've fallen off the American politcal scale, sometime around 1996-2000. I was born (1980) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plainfield,_Vermont">Plainfield, Vermont</a>, and grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island (1988-2004). I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology from the University of Rhode Island, on a full tuition scholarship. After 2004, I moved back to Plainfield, Vermont, in search of graduate school positions and scientific work, where I remained, waiting, patiently, until about 2014, when I ran for Congress, and debated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQTLoaJMH2k">Rep. Peter Welch</a> (D., now Senator), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@randallmeyer20001">others</a>, on Vermont Public Television. Despite my sincere reservations about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobless_recovery">direction</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_income,_no_asset">country</a> was going in, my warnings, apparently, went unheeded, and I remain under-utilized and un-utilized, in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_of_despair">modern</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States">miracle</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackler_family#Opioid_lawsuits">economy</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ninja-loan.asp">poisionous economy</a>. Period, full stop.</p>

     <p style="color:Red;">Dobro Hobo, for U.S.Ho ; 2024</p>
  
<p style="color:black;">When I claim to be Far-Left, I should be a bit more specific. It is more accurate to call me extremely progressive, though, due to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(evolutionary_biology)#Evolutionary_iconography">professional proclivities and obligations</a>, and to some phislosophical predilections, "progressive" must be understood in a somewhat limited sense. I am, however, emphatically not Socialist or Communist, though I do not shrink from the labels, as I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">pejorative</a> to be a dull and dimwitted, and extremely outdated one (we are, after all, "all Keynesians, now...", as one noted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_all_Keynesians_now">wag</a> has commented.). I am, however, a full-throated supporter of community and society, which share the root words of those dreaded "-isms", but I also support, and enjoy, capital, the root-word for the other "boogeyman" of modern politics, "capitalism". Here I part with many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_International_Party">"Liberals"</a>, who often assume that possession of "capital" or profession of ideas which support the creation of value, which often involves the creation and/or use of capital, is somehow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuppie">"selling out"</a>. Money, like community and society, is an OK thing to value; it is the elevation of these things to "-isms", <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/religiously-congress-doesnt-reflect-modern-america-pew-finds">reified</a> to God-like or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Religion">religious</a> status, which causes problems (in my opinion).</p>

<p style="color:black;">About halfway through my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rhode_Island">bachelor's degree</a> (circa 1998-2002), I began to suspect that I was an evolution biologist, and not as destined for a career in marine biology, as I had previously thought. I was quite enamoured with the works of Stephen Jay Gould, and with the history of life, as exemplified by the famous studies of the three dimensional, soft-bodied, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Life_(book)">Burgess shale fossils</a> and of Edicarean fauna (Vendobionta). This new perspective, and its competing instantiations as promulgated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Dawkins</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">Dennett</a>, E.O. Wilson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures">Chomsky</a>, and others, provided part of a worldview that was at least moderately hostile to any notion of absolute or true "progress"; since even the lowliest living tapeworm is as equally "evolved" or "progressed" as any other extant living creature. But for our present purposes, the purposes of politics, and as a general humanistic philosophy, I accept a more limited use of the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb">"progress"</a> and apply it to improving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich">lot and condition</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_milestones">8 billion people</a> on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation">earth</a>, for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population">continued health</a>, <a href="https://populationmatters.org/quotes/">happiness</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus">peaceable co-existence</a>.</p>

<p style="color:black;">Turning from the philosophical, semantic, and from vocabulary items and definitions, and continuing in the vein of the biographical, I do not believe it is hyperbole or braggadocio to claim that my life experience and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">broad</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy">philosophical</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics">background</a> is outsized when viewed next to my actual resume-worthy achievements. It is hard to describe, or explain, but I am a bit humbled looking back at a useful life, that was lived, and actually actively constructed, by me, despite the incessant employment-related setbacks. I did manage about 6 months as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">mortgage</a> company temp (light office work and document collection and storage), about 6 months as a food technician at a regional and national dairy company/co-operative, and about 6 months in quality control, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_thermal_processing#Rapid_thermal_anneal">Rapid Thermal Anneal Operator</a>, at an international, Forbes 500, semiconductor, computer chip manufacturing company. Despite these jobs, and the soul-sucking toll they exacted upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce_Mountain_(Vermont)">"man of the woods"</a>, I managed, in each case, respectively, to further my true aims, first, by taking additional botany courses (a marine biologist has little need for expertise concerning the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagrass">vascular plants</a>, since the ocean is largely devoid of them!), and, second, by purchasing a book <a href="https://spie.org/publications/book/374903">"Scientific Charge Coupled Devices"</a>, authored by <a href="http://www.digicamhistory.com/Janesick_Continued.html">James</a> <a href="http://www.digicamhistory.com/Janesink_Continued.html">Janesick</a> (at the time, circa 2003-2005, approx. 300-500$, a week's paycheck!) and third, by using my tech employment to support myself while I imagined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">"Post-Moore's Law"</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpgV6rCn5-g">world</a>; a world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#Strong_AI">Strong-A.I.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer%27s_law">governed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipps%E2%80%93Meyer_law">largely</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakubinskij%27s_law">by</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_of_articles_on_Wikipedia">"Meyer's</a> <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?BertrandMeyerAndWikipedia">(Linguistic)</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_of_articles_on_Wikipedia">Law"</a>. In this last case, I used my time off to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">study</a>, intently, electrical engineering, optical engineering, human vision, and digital imaging, amongst <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=57868">other subjects</a>. </p>

  <p style="color:black;"> You'll note, if you've followed some of the links, directly above, that I attempted to publish during my "exiled academician" period (2004-2019), and was even rebuffed by such free speech advocates and Techno-Libertarians as Wikipedia (and, by extension, Jimmy Wales). Wikipedia editors, it seems, were satisfied that I was a failed third party candidate in Vermont, in 2014, but not a censored academician in the preceding period, 2004-2014, or from 2014 afterwards, despite my physical location in Canada and my official paperwork proclaiming my intent to seek poltical asylum in Canada in 2020-2022. The standards for evidence and the politeness and neutrality of Wikipedia editors leaves much to be desired, in my considered and, now, expert opinion.</p>

 <p style="color:black;"> WHERE IS THE CAMPAIGN, RIGHT NOW? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXQJ9xXxvq8">This</a> video is from the final week collecting signatures for nomination to the primary. The primary votes must all be submitted by August 10, 2024, 7PM. Mail-in Ballots should be turned in to the USPS by August 5th, and in person voting can occur from July 29th to Augsut 10 at ballot dropboxes and election office voting centers. The main campaign youtube channel, despite its lack of political postings, slogans, or political songs, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RandallMeyerforU.S.Congress2nd">here</a>. With limited time and resources with which to mount an effective campaign, and my serious reservations about such "cult of perosnality", popularity contests, in the first place, I have some 5 or 6 weeks (circa July 1st, as I write this), to spread fliers in neighborhood canvassing campaigns, and I may even give out a few musical CDs (my college songs, circa early 2000s, and my 30s, "College-Communtiy-Radio-DJ" songs, circa early 2010s), if I can fix (or replace) my malfunctioning CD burner! UPDATE(08/19/24): As of August 10, 2024, I am includeed on the general election ballot for November 2024, having gained some 570+ votes, exceeding that number garnered by the Libertarian Party candidate, and "piggybacking" on hisa success within the party system. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT, thus far, and see you, out there, this November!!!</p>

   <p style="color:black;"> HOW IS MY <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Research.html">RESEARCH</a>? It is, surprisingly, doing well, thanks for asking! This section is probably under active construction (early July 2024), as the research is ongoing, so I will just add a few broken links here, until I get the basics "fleshed out". Alluded to above, Meyer's Law, and the associated Meyer-Hardy-Weinberg Eqillibruium was censored and silenced, circa 2003, when I was ostracised and black-balled--albeit, politely, and subtly--from academia. I was further silenced, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election_in_Vermont">several times</a>, by <a href="https://github.com/LadnarofLadner/LadnarofLadner.github.io/blob/main/Wikipedia%20Revenge%20Meyer%20Hardy%20Weinbrerg%20Equillibrium%201%201.jpg?raw=true">gutless wikipedia editors</a>, and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch">minor bureacratic tyrants</a> (preferring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections">describe me</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Hawaii">"failed politician"</a> rather than admitting that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont%27s_at-large_congressional_district">silenced and censored academician</a>!). A quick list of the successful research since that inital raw deal would include <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/AnthropoidImagers.html">(1) designs for anthropomorphic imagers</a>, both FOIC and CCD/CMOS Roughly-Spherical Goldberg Polyhedra Tesselations, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/MeyersOpticalApproximationoftheHumanEye.html">(2) Meyer's Optical Approximation of the Human Eye</a>; both as mathematical model and as an empirical, engineered and manufactured instantiation, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/MeyersLaw.html">(3) Meyer's Law</a>, stated, for simplicity, here, as VN^2=S, and derived from the permutation and combination equations and the simplest cross-cultural accounting of human linguistic typologies, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/MassivelyParallelAnthropomorphicOlfactoryandGustatoryTransducers.html">(4) Massively Parallel Anthropomorphic (Anthropo-Functional) Olfactory and Gustatory Transducers</a>, <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/MeyersStandardStrongA.I.Directories(MSSAID).html">(5) Meyer's Standard Strong A.I.

     <p style="color:black;"> STRATEGY FOR HAWAII VOTERS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Democratic_Revolution_of_1954">SOME OF THE BLUEST OF THE BLUE!!!!</a>). You might be thinking, at this point, (a) "Hey Randall, are you delusional? Third parties never win! Do you want to ruin the chances for Democratic victory and deliver the nation up to the Imperialist, Christian Nationalist, Bigots?" or, more directly to the point, (b) "If I vote for you then I would just offer up a <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/ralph-nader-third-party-politics-2024-interview/">spoiler candidate</a> for the general election, and I want Jill Tokuda, ultimately, to win.", and (c) "Hey? Aren't you a carpetbagger? Go back to Vermont, where you came from!". Responding to these first two concerns, I say, do you think Jill Tokuda will represent your interests, specifically? Does she have any incentive to do so? Did you donate more than, say, $1,000 to her re-election campaign? If you didn't, you probably don't matter to her. Sure, hypothetically, she cares, but when its time to write legislation, where and when it REALLY counts, only the donors will be listened to. As for the Reprobate party candidate, he is guaranteed to be a bit worse than the Demagogues, but I won't be debating him, or even learning his name, or responding to his hypocritical nonsense, in any dignified and civilized fashion. As far as I am concerned the Reprobates are at best (a) philsophically moribund, and at worst--and more likely--(b) unabashedly, unapologetically, hypocritical, unempirical, illogical, and characterized--at least for the entirety of my adult life (approximately 30 years)--by a 100% rhetorical style of argumentation; appealing only to the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and to the fear and reward responses of the psyche of the human animal. It is gaslighting, plain and simple. As far as I am concerned, in a race between Jill Tokuda and I (and possibly others) I am at least a close second, and perhaps the winner. The 5 things I MIGHT have respected about the Reprobates were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_and_the_Lying_Liars_Who_Tell_Them">blatant lies</a> in the 1990s, and now, 20 years later, full-on gaslighting and dog-and-pony tricks. Of the five Reprobate myths (a) Law and Order, (b) Family Values, (c) more knowledgeable about history, (d) experts at foreign policy and (e) fiscally conservative, the Reprobates have shown themselves to care only about their own families, and their own values--almost exculusively christian--, and to be abysmally educated regarding accurate and precise histories--and, similarly, philosophies,--and thus, completely incompetent at charting a path forward in foreign policy, or providing common sense defense, in the nuclear, overpopulated, global trade age, and, finally, they also show themselves as executers of only such law as keeps themselves and their families rich and use order to slam the hammer down on anybody else who imagines themselves capable of success in America. My father didn't go to Vietnam to protect the Constitution for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush#Military_career">these</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_military_service_controversy">schmucks</a> (who invariably <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Lawsuits.html">ignore</a> my legitimate complaints, or use the Constitution against me, in blatantly unconstitutional ways), or for these <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bush072899.htm">"state-side flyboys"</a>; these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Early_life">"silver-spoon draft-dodgers"</a>. See <a href="Rossman and Meyer and Patent.bmp">here</a>, for my great-grandfather's patent, and a nice photo of my father and me and my two brothers (circa 1986-88). Three generations of smart, hard-working, technological Americans, robbed by a defunct ideology (several, in fact!), and by a nation, acting through its power to implement said ideologies. You can help put a stop to it. I don't believe Jill Tokuda, or the rest of the Demagogues, has any chance at elucidating the problem, properly, much less at fixing it. </p>
