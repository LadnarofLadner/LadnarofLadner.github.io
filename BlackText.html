<p style="color:black;">Thank you for navigating to my page, and thanks, in advance, for your support. Here is a little bit of <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Biography.html">biographical</a> and practical (political, philsophical) information about me. Though the ballot reads <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Nonpartisan.html">"Non-Partisan"</a>, I am so <a href="https://ladnarofladner.github.io/Far-Left.html">Far-Left</a> that I've fallen off the American politcal scale, sometime around 1996-2000. I was born (1980) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plainfield,_Vermont">Plainfield, Vermont</a>, and grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island (1988-2004). I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology from the University of Rhode Island, on a full tuition scholarship. After 2004, I moved back to Plainfield, Vermont, in search of graduate school positions and scientific work, where I remained, waiting, patiently, until about 2014, when I ran for Congress, and debated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQTLoaJMH2k">Rep. Peter Welch</a> (D., now Senator), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@randallmeyer20001">others</a>, on Vermont Public Television. Despite my sincere reservations about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobless_recovery">direction</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_income,_no_asset">country</a> was going in, my warnings, apparently, went unheeded, and I remain under-utilized and un-utilized, in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_of_despair">modern</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States">miracle</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackler_family#Opioid_lawsuits">economy</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ninja-loan.asp">poisionous economy</a>. Period, full stop.</p>

<p style="color:black;">When I claim to be Far-Left, I should be a bit more specific. It is more accurate to call me extremely progressive, though, due to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(evolutionary_biology)#Evolutionary_iconography">professional proclivities and obligations</a>, and to some phislosophical predilections, "progressive" must be understood in a somewhat limited sense. I am, however, emphatically not Socialist or Communist, though I do not shrink from the labels, as I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">pejorative</a> to be a dull and dimwitted, and extremely outdated one (we are, after all, "all Keynesians, now...", as one noted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_all_Keynesians_now">wag</a> has commented.). I am, however, a full-throated supporter of community and society, which share the root words of those dreaded "-isms", but I also support, and enjoy, capital, the root-word for the other "boogeyman" of modern politics, "capitalism". Here I part with many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_International_Party">"Liberals"</a>, who often assume that possession of "capital" or profession of ideas which support the creation of value, which often involves the creation and/or use of capital, is somehow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuppie">"selling out"</a>. Money, like community and society, is an OK thing to value; it is the elevation of these things to "-isms", reified to God-like or religious status, which causes problems (in my opinion).</p>

<p style="color:black;">About halfway through my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rhode_Island">bachelor's degree</a> (circa 1998-2002), I began to suspect that I was an evolution biologist, and not as destined for a career in marine biology, as I had previously thought. I was quite enamoured with the works of Stephen Jay Gould, and with the history of life, as exemplified by the famous studies of the three dimensional, soft-bodied, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Life_(book)">Burgess shale fossils</a> and of Edicarean fauna (Vendobionta). This new perspective, and its competing instantiations as promulgated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Dawkins</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">Dennett</a>, E.O. Wilson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures">Chomsky</a>, and others, provided part of a worldview that was at least moderately hostile to any notion of absolute or true "progress"; since even the lowliest living tapeworm is as equally "evolved" or "progressed" as any other extant living creature. But for our present purposes, the purposes of politics, and as a general humanistic philosophy, I accept a more limited use of the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb">"progress"</a> and apply it to improving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich">lot and condition</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_milestones">8 billion people</a> on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation">earth</a>, for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population">continued health</a>, happiness, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus">peaceable co-existence</a>.</p>

<p style="color:black;">Turning from the philosophical, semantic, and from vocabulary items and definitions, and continuing in the vein of the biographical, I do not believe it is hyperbole or braggadocio to claim that my life experience and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">broad</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy">philosophical</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics">background</a> is outsized when viewed next to my actual resume-worthy achievements. It is hard to describe, or explain, but I am a bit humbled looking back at a useful life, that was lived, and actually actively constructed, by me, despite the incessant employment-related setbacks. I did manage about 6 months as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">mortgage</a> company temp (light office work and document collection and storage), about 6 months as a food technician at a regional and national dairy company/co-operative, and about 6 months in quality control, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_thermal_processing#Rapid_thermal_anneal">Rapid Thermal Anneal Operator</a>, at an international, Forbes 500, semiconductor, computer chip manufacturing company. Despite these jobs, and the soul-sucking toll they exacted upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce_Mountain_(Vermont)">"man of the woods"</a>, I managed, in each case, respectively, to further my true aims, first, by taking additional botany courses (a marine biologist has little need for expertise concerning the true vascular plants<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagrass"> vascular plants</a>, since the ocean is largely devoid of them!), and, second, by purchasing a book <a href="https://spie.org/publications/book/374903">"Scientific Charge Coupled Devices"</a>, authored by <a href="http://www.digicamhistory.com/Janesick_Continued.html">James</a> <a href="http://www.digicamhistory.com/Janesink_Continued.html">Janesick</a> (at the time, circa 2003-2005, approx. 300-500$, a week's paycheck!) and third, by using my tech employment to support myself while I imagined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">"Post-Moore's Law"</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpgV6rCn5-g">world</a>; a world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#Strong_AI">Strong-A.I.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer%27s_law">governed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipps%E2%80%93Meyer_law">largely</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakubinskij%27s_law">by</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_of_articles_on_Wikipedia">"Meyer's</a> <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?BertrandMeyerAndWikipedia">(Linguistic)</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_of_articles_on_Wikipedia">Law"</a>. In this last case, I used my time off to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">study</a>, intently, electrical engineering, optical engineering, human vision, and digital imaging, amongst <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=57868">other subjects</a>. </p>

  <p style="color:black;"> You'll note, if you've followed some of the links, directly above, that I attempted to publish during my "exiled academician" period (2004-2019), and was even rebuffed by such free speech advocates and Techno-Libertarians as Wikipedia (and, by extension, Jimmy Wales). Wikipedia editors, it seems, were satisfied that I was a failed third party candidate in Vermont, in 2014, but not a censored academician in the preceding period, 2004-2014, or from 2014 afterwards, despite my physical location in canada and my official paperwork proclaiming my intent to seek poltical asylum in Canada in 2020-2022. The standards for evidence and the politeness and neuytrality of Wikipeida editors leaves much to be desired, in my considered and, now, expert opuinion.</p>
