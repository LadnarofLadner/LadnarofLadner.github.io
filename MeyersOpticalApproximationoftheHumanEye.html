  <p>Two Diagrams : (1) Hyperbolic Section of the Planar Ground, via Appolonious of Perga and (2) 60 degree Half-Angle, 120 degree Full-Angle Approximation of the Monocular Human Eye Field of View.</p>

     <p style="color:Red;">Stickn Figure sees 120 degrees, monocularly. 12.5 cm. near point, and 1 meter to 5 meter, far accomodation, depending upon illumination levels and depth of field and depth of focus.</p>

     <p style="color:Red;">Appolonious was smart ! And that's no Hyperbola !</p>

<p>Four Data Tables : (1) Wertheim, circa 1891 Peripheral Visual Acuity and (2) Alpern et. al, circa 1960 "Near Triad", (3) Davson (Campbell?)  Depth of Field data and (4) Lorrin Riggs (Graham, 1960) and the four types of acuity.</p>

<p> Bibliogrpahy> 1. Euclid, trans. Harry Edwin Burton, circa 1945, and (2) Lunenburg, Rudolph, "A Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision", 1945  (3) Wertheim, 1891 Peripheral Visual Acuity, (4) Alpern et. al, 1960 "Near Triad", (5) Davson (Campbell?)  Depth of Field, (6) Lorrin Riggs (Graham, 1960), (7) Adler, Irving "A New Look at Geomtery".</p>

<p> As Adler once declared "Euclid Dethroned, Euclid Triumphant", we might wish to reassess this pronouncement, given that he made it some ten or so years after the first translation of Euclid's "Optics" into the English language, and at a similar temporal distance, too, to Lunenberg's Non-Euclidean analyses of human vision. Indeed, an empirical view of the parameters of human vision might be more illuminating to our modern perspective than the more abstruse and mathematical, theoretical perspectives offered by the mathemagicians I've cited.</p>
