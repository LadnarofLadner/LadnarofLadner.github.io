     <p style="color:Black;">Here is a list of all the half decent and/or 1/2 finished or 3/4 finished songs that I felt like preserving. I probably write a song a day, but most chord progressions and melodies die a day or two later when the lyrics fail to materialize and I move on to other favored melodies. I have a musical bandwidth, and can create and "cement" no faster or prolifically than I already do. So, sorry for all the "lost classics" that I never borthered to create or finsh. But here are some good arrangements, with mostly good lyrics, and some with excellent lyrics, and almost always, wonderful chords, fingerpicking, open tunings, complex rhythyms and nice harmonies and melodies.</p>
